"Sailing" is my first EP that I released as The Music Plays You, an ambient instrumental solo project, on Feb 13, 2013. It was an attempt to learn the process of recording, mixing, & mastering, as well as getting musical ideas out of my head & sharing them with the world.

"Sailing" is dedicated to my mother, who gifted me with my musical talents and abilities, & to my father, who introduced me to a wide variety of artists and sparked my interest in guitar.

You can pay what you want for the album [via Bandcamp](https://themusicplaysyou.bandcamp.com/album/sailing), or [listen wherever you get your music](https://album.link/i/1448532667).
