Well, I intended to do this quarterly, but I kinda dropped the ball on it, so I guess I'll be doing 3 updates this year on my [goals progress][goals]. Mostly for me, but also for you!

<!-- more -->

### Goal 1: Lose 36 lbs

I'm currently down 8.4lbs, which is great! However, I lost 8.8lbs in the first month, when I was hyper-focused on my goal (and I got the flu and a nasty cold, which sucked but also helped me shed some weight pretty fast). Also, if I wanted to be keeping pace, I should be down an extra 3.6lbs (12.4 net), so I'm a little behind there. I'm looking forward to getting back into yoga heavily, focusing hard on what I'm eating, and getting out on the bike as the weather warms up.

### Goal 2: Cook 12 new recipes

I'm currently sitting at 7, with most of those coming in the first month as we got hyper-focused on eating better. The Egg Roll in a Bowl is outstanding, and we've made it a handful of times since. The cucumber chips are probably my wife's favorite. Looking forward to some more stuff out on the grill!

### Goal 3: Record 12 songs, and release a new album

Honestly not sure if this is going to happen or not. I've had a few realizations in the past few weeks that have helped me understand why I have such a hard time making music nowadays, and I'm not sure if that's something I'm going to be able to get past or not. I have TONS of ideas ready to go, though.

### Goal 4: Complete 12 video games

Bad news: I haven't completed any yet.

Good news: I have 5 in flight, with 3 (Pokemon Let's Go, Dark Souls 1, and Half Life) nearing the finish line.

GREAT news: Last night, [I hit Gold in League of Legends][leagueTweet] on my main account. This is something I've been trying to do for 6 years now, and I finally accomplished my goal. I immediately uninstalled the game, as I know I have a HUGE backlog to get through. I'll likely go back in June, but I wanted to force myself to have May to focus on other games. I don't have League, Overwatch, WoW, or Apex installed currently, so we'll see if that helps galvanize me.

### Goal 5: Read 12 books

I'm super impressed as to how well I've done on this so far. 5 books down, although technically only 4 count, as I had a mini-rule that only 3 of the books I read could be repeats. *The Armored Saint* by Myke Cole is the only new book I've read so far this year (and it was great!). Up next is *The Eye of the World*, the first of the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan.

### Goal 6: Write 36 blog posts

Not doing great here! I should be at 12, but this is #5 (although I have at least 3 more topics in the works). Once I start getting some games completed, that will help as well. If you've got any topics you'd like me to write about, PLEASE let me know!

### Goal 7: Finish writing (and start running) my D&D campaign

This goal has hit a major speed bump. For one, I've not made the time to work on this since February. For another, my D&D group has not played in over a month; schedules have gotten crazy, a child has been born, and we've just not made it a priority for ourselves. This was last on my list for a reason, as I wanted to prioritize pretty much everything else above it, but I would like to do more with this at some point soon.

So there it is; my 4 month update. Some goals are going great, some not so great... but that's ok! These were just guidelines to help me feel like I'm doing something with my year, and things always change in terms of life priorities and the like. 

*How are your goals going? Do you need some motivation? Do you have any motivation for me? Use the hashtag #GoalsUpdate when you [message me on Twitter][twitter] and let's chat!*
