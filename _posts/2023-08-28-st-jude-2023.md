My daughter turned 18 months old today. It feels like just yesterday, she was a tiny blob that I had to burp multiple times a day. Now, she's devouring chicken, speaking in her own fun language ("no" means no, but an emphatic "NO!" means yes, which is gonna get me into trouble when we're in public), and generally being the coolest kid ever.

She is perfect and wonderful and healthy. But what if she wasn't? What if we took her in for a checkup and the doctor told us "hey, so, V has cancer"?

<!-- more -->

**(VERY IMPORTANT POINT OF EMPHASIS - SHE IS FINE, PERFECTLY HEALTHY, DOES NOT HAVE CANCER, ETC. - THE PURE HAPPENSTANCE OF HER HALF-BIRTHDAY FALLING ON THE DAY OF THE CAMPAIGN LAUNCH IS JUST A COINCIDENCE)**

That's why I'm partnering with [the Relay FM podcast community][relay] during September (which just so happens to be Childhood Cancer Awareness Month) to help raise money for [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital][stjude]. [Here is a link to my campaign where you can donate][campaign].

**UPDATE: I had set a very modest goal of raising $250, and promised to match it. I figured I'd need to post 30 times to get anywhere close to that, but y'all crushed this goal within 5 hours. That rules.**

If you aren’t aware, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is the world leader in understanding, treating, and defeating childhood cancer & other life-threatening diseases. The majority of their funding comes from generous donors, and it allows them to not only lead the way on life-saving research, but also provide treatment at little to no cost for the patient & families. As a parent, I couldn’t even imagine what it would be like to find out that she had cancer, and not being able to get the help we needed.

Relay FM has been raising money for St. Jude every September since 2019. Together, their community has raised over $2.2m, and their goal this year is to eclipse the $2.5m threshold. They're a wonderful group of humans using their platform to raise money for a good cause, and I've loved taking part in helping them do that.

One more time, for the people who have scrolled this far - [here's a link to my fundraising campaign][campaign], and [a link directly to the donation page][donate]. Any amount is welcome. Any amount is amazing. Any amount will make a difference in the life of a child, both today and in the years to come.
