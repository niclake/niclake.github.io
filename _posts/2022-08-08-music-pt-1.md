I was talking with a group of friends in our Discord this past weekend, and a great prompt came up. _"Share 3 songs that you feel like summarize your musical preferences/your journey through discovering new styles of music."_

Y'all realize how hard it is to narrow that prompt down to just **three** songs? Cripes.

Anyway, I fulfilled the prompt, but a lot of us were talking about our honorable mentions. This led me down a rabbit hole of figuring out what were my personal defining songs from my life, and now... well, it turned into 3 blog posts.

### History

Prior to high school, I listened to a ton of different stuff. My first 3 albums that I ever owned were (lol in advance) **Spice Girls - _Spice_**, **Hanson - _Middle of Nowhere_**, and the **Mortal Kombat Annihilation soundtrack**. I then dabbled with a lot of **Creed** and other Christian-adjacent bands as I learned to play drums, bass, and guitar over the years. But none of that was really what I considered "formative" - most of those bands I'd heard on the radio, or was convinced by my mom to buy the CDs. **Mortal Kombat** was an out of the blue album purchase for me - I'd played the video games in the arcades, but didn't even see the movie until I was in my 20s. I was pretty much relying on other people's suggestions of what music to listen to until 1999/2000, when I was 12-13.

### Jr. High, High School, & Early College (1999 - 2007)

Around 99/2000, I finally started to break out of the shell of "listen to music my parents recommend", and found things via friends that I really enjoyed. I've included a Spotify playlist of 12 fongs from that time that I loved/continue to love today, and either where I can picture myself listening to the song, or why I love it so much. (I'm including a Spotify playlist here, but I'll link every song on YouTube as well.)

**Deftones - [_My Own Summer (Shove It)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOzs1FehYOA)** - My cousin Cory has always been a very gifted drummer and musician, and I looked up to him a lot. Always loved going over to his house as a kid and playing drums (he's now got his Masters in Jazz Studies). I still remember him playing **Rage Against The Machine** and Deftones for me as a "check this out" sort of deal, and opening my eyes to a new world of music.

**Linkin Park - [_Krwlng_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfviFOcnlew)** - I still remember throwing on **_Hybrid Theory_** for the first time on a way back from some church camp my friend and I went to, and being blown away. The emotion I felt from Chester's vocals and the band's instrumentation gripped me and changed my perception on a lot of things. While HT and **_Meteora_** continue to be amazing albums, **_Reanimation_** has some absolutely incredible remixes, and the harmonies on Krwlng make the original song 300% better.

**Norma Jean - [_Creating Something Out Of Nothing, Only To Destroy It_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxgaoGkaU_c)** - There was a concert venue just down the street from where I grew up called The Reverb. It was a dimly lit bar on the 2nd floor above some Main Street businesses. I'd be down there nearly once a week, going to shows of my friend's bands, or other bands that came through. We had a pretty robust straight-edge/hardcore scene (x319x), and I still remember how energetic and chaotic the Norma Jean show I went to was. An absolutely incredible memory.

**Beloved - [_Death to Traitors_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6_v3xuuk8)** - I latched on to Beloved as one of my favorite hardcore bands, simply because they brought more melodic structure to their music. They played a show at the local rec center that was a block from my house, and it was nuts seeing kids running all over, playing basketball or throwing a football, while this band set up in the corner and just absolutely ripped.

**Anberlin - [_Ready Fuels_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FadZ-KHW92Y)** - I don't remember exactly how I discovered Anberlin, but this was their very first track off their first album, and it spawned a nearly 2 decades long infatuation with this band. I spent many an afternoon in my room playing along to this album on my guitar and bass.

**Billy Music - [_Stereofoam_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL6IxJ4MdnU)** - A band that came through my hometown and played a show, and then practically dropped off the face of the planet. I would love to get a group of friends together and cover this whole album top to bottom. Stereofoam is in my top 10 songs of all time.

**Incubus - [_Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT7aDgdPDYQ)** - My friend Steve LOVED Incubus. Their mainstream releases were all really good, but I fell in love with their super early stuff (Fungus Amongus and S.C.I.E.N.C.E.). This is a song we'd casually drop while playing pep band gigs (along with **_Are You In?** from _Morning View_).

**Thursday - [_War All The Time_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAD6lJiHBdA)** - Oh yeah, I definitely had an emo phase that I went through. I distinctly remember listening to this album while sitting at my desk waiting for 1st period Trig to start. This album, plus _Full Collapse_, were on frequent rotation for me.

**Underoath - [_Down, Set, Go_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K70VfYtWpX4)** - Underoath is a band that I still continue to listen to on repeat to this day. Soaring melodies, heavy hitting riffs... this band had everything I wanted back in the day, and their music still resonates today. I moshed right alongside a bunch of youths when I saw them live a few years ago.

**Mae - [_Suspension_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDMcotLp2yY)** - One of those churchy-adjacent bands that I listened to a lot of, Mae's music has always been this melodic punky vibe that I seem to click with. The main guitar riff was one that I still play to this day when I pick up a guitar.

**Relient K - [_Devestation and Reform_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w8FVBr5M-s)** - Exact same as **_Suspension** above, with the only difference being that I'm in the music video for this song.

**MUTEMATH - [_Typical_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XVWR-5fiG0)** - My college girlfriend and I went to go see The Fray play at her college. Wasn't a fan, but it was live music, so why not? MUTEMATH opened for them, and absolutely blew them out of the water. Such an incredible performance, I was completely hyped and energized. Bought the t-shirts, the CDs, everything. God, that was such a good show.

So there we have it. Music of my formative years, ages 12 to 20. Anything you love or vibe with? I'd love to hear about it.
