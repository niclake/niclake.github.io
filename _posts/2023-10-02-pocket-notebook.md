I've been carrying a notebook around in my pocket for a week now. Maybe it's the "hipster" thing to do, but I've wanted to use a pen and paper for... something. It's taken me ages to figure out what, but I think I've landed on something.

From the first page:

> This notebook is going to be a journal of things that give me joy. I want a reason to carry around a pen & notebook, & I can think of no better reason to have one.

Having this kind of mission, of purpose, has led me to reach for it multiple times per day. Focusing on joy has helped me lean in to the happy moments I experience.

Maybe my daughter will find these tucked in a box one day and flip through them. I hope so.
