**We took a nice vacation at the end of April/beginning of May,** heading down to visit my wife's sister & family in North Carolina. Pre-child, we would just make the 11 or 13.5hr (depending on origin) drive to NC in one day; lately, we've been breaking it into 3 or 4 days so that V isn't stuck in the van for too long, but we'd just stop for the night and depart the next day. This time, we actually hit up some of the spots we've always been looking at during our drives. We spent 2 days at a nice resort with a small waterpark, and took V to an aquarium as well. It was a wonderful time, and I love that our kiddo has forced us out of our shell to do and experience new things. V also had a blast playing with her older cousins, so that was fantastic.

**I finally got back out to the wood shop**, this time starting on a simple pen/pencil tray for all of the stuff I have on my desk every day. Spent 3x as long figuring out how to make the grooves than I did actually cutting. Always love being able to get out there and work, and hoping to prioritize that more this summer.

**The wife and I have been watching a TON of the NBA playoffs**. Both of our teams (Celtics for me, Timberwolves for her) have advanced to their respective conference finals, and presumably could be on a collision course to play in the NBA Finals. That would be a ton of fun.

**V is getting a swing set.** This did involve 1 massive parts order + 2 trips to the hardware store, and it's still not done. But she saw her new swing and _flipped out_, running around the house shouting "BLUE SWING BLUE SWING BLUE SWING", so that's dope. +1 dad point.

**We have nature all around our house,** and we're loving it. My wife is thrilled to have a ton of plants and landscaping to work on & make nice. V is a huge fan of being outside at all times, and now that she's a bit older, she's able to go out with her mom and "help" with various things. We've been in the house for exactly 1 year as of today, and the difference in the landscaping has been night and day.

We've got a bunch of friends around the house too. There's a chipmunk we've dubbed "Chippy" that loves to hang out just off our deck practically all day, and they've realized they can get on our squirrel-proof bird feeders and eat the seed no problem. Hooray?

We've also got some baby birds that have hatched in one of our hanging baskets on the front porch. Mama has been aloof a bit, but she's started cautiously coming back to the nest while we sit on the front porch. It's been cool to get the basket down to water the plant every day or two and see the growth the birds are making; V really enjoys looking at them too. ("Baby birds!!!")

**I'm trying to take a page out of the cat's book on the weekends**; it's nice to get stuff done and great to feel productive, but it's also important to just chill and relax and soak up the sun a little bit. (As such, I forgot to hit "post" on this until Monday morning. Oops.)
