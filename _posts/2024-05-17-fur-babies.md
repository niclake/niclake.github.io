I joke that in our household, I'm the 6th most important living being. The ranking goes: V (our daughter), R (my wife), Bearcat & Beau (our cats), all of the plants inside and out as one entity, and then myself.[^1] I figured I should take this day and introduce you to our boys, because they're great.

[^1]: I was the one that coined this ranking. My wife doesn't disagree.

## Bearcat

My wife adopted Bearcat 2 months before we started dating. He was the loner cat, tucked away in a cage in the cat room because he didn't get along with any of the other cats. She took pity on him, and he became the sweetest cat you'll ever meet. When he was adopted, they estimated that he was anywhere from 1-3 years old; I've always estimated on the lower side because I don't want to admit that we have an old cat, but he's probably around 13 years old now. He's only about 10lbs., relatively small for a fully grown cat. He's got crazy crumpled up ears, likely do to ear mites from when he was a stray, and my wife thought he looked like a bear, so Bearcat stuck.[^2]

[^2]: Most vets that we've taken to have him listed in their system as "Bear"; it takes a lot of convincing that his name is actually "Bearcat".

The best possible way to describe Bearcat is that he's like the most chill dog you've ever met. He's cool doing his own thing, but when he wants your attention he demands it (I spent about an hour this morning with him sprawled in front of my keyboard while I worked). He opened my eyes to how loving a cat can be, and he's been our best bud through our entire relationship. He'd sleep on my wife's passenger seat when she'd drive up to visit me for long weekends, and has been with us through 2 apartments and 2 houses.

## Beau

Beau was our pandemic baby. We weren't really sure if adding a (at the time) 3rd cat to the family was the best idea, but we decided to go for it, and it worked out amazingly. We *almost* didn't get to adopt him. The timeline was kinda weird:

- Our friend (who fostered kittens for the ARL) posted a photo of Beau, and I immediately fell in love.
- I tried to convince my wife that we should adopt him. After about a week, she was like "hmm ok maybe".
- I reached out to our friend to express interest, and was told he'd been adopted by Family A. I was bummed.
- About a week later, Friend posted another photo of Beau, stating that the adoption with Family A had fallen through.
- Convincing and cajoling took place, but I finally got my wife on board. Hurray!
- I message Friend, and was told "oh yeah, sorry, Family B adopted him". ***FUCK!!!***
- On a whim, I tell Friend that if for whatever reason he became available again to please let us know.
- Friend posts a video of her introducing the kitten litter to her other pets, including 2 small-ish dogs. Beau seems afraid of said dogs.
- I get a message from Friend on Sunday morning; Family B has backed out because they have 2 huskies, and worry about compatibility.
- We're at her house 3 hours later meeting Beau.
- We brought him home that Thursday.

Beau is hilarious; random things still frighten him to a degree, like "moving your foot while sitting on the couch" or "sneezing" or "petting him"; in the mornings when he's hyper, it just leads to lots of zoomies. He has the most incessant meow, as well as little "woofs" he does when I stop petting him for more than 5 seconds. He also loves to nibble on parts of me while being petted, including fingers, toes, and my kneecaps(???). He's *massive* (16+ lbs) but not fat; the last vet we took him to saw him and immediately went "holy shit, he's **awesome**!" He constantly wants to play with Bearcat, and it's hit or miss whether they chase each other around the house (maybe 5% of the time) or it leads to Beau getting smacked in the head (the other 95%).

## Pixel

I wrote [a nice eulogy for Pixel](https://niclake.me/pixel/) last June; we're rapidly approaching the date of his passing, and I'm slowly starting to process the grief all over again. I miss him every day; he loved V and would've had a blast growing up with her.

We adopted Pixel a bit recklessly; we'd been told since day 1 that Bearcat was a loner, that we shouldn't bring another cat into the home, yadda yadda. But we saw him at a mall kiosk one day, and just knew that we had to bring him home. He was the funniest animal I've ever been around, constantly up to antics that would land him in comical situations. He was the social butterfly, forcing Bearcat (and eventually Beau) to love him, and bridging the gap between them. He took to V right away, always wanting to see what she was up to, letting her hug him or pull his fur. He'd find the most narrow slice of sunlight coming through a window, and would live there the rest of the afternoon. He had the softest fur of any animal I've ever met. He was the best.

Alternate names: Snowball, Big Floof

Our cats are a part of our family, so much so that we have people stay at our house when we're on vacation to keep them company. Having a child has certainly changed our dynamic more, and I've been cognizant of making sure I spend a lot of time downstairs with them in the evenings so that they don't feel left out. They're the best, and I'm gonna go pet them right now, in fact.
