![alt text][headerImg]

If you've been keeping tabs on my [2019 goals][2019goals], it's pretty apparent that I whiffed on juuuuust about all of them.

If you read my [recent post about patience][patience], you'll know that I intend to be better about that by breaking them down into much smaller, more easily achievable chunks.

I'm tired of missing the boat on all of my goals, getting discouraged, and feeling like I didn't accomplish anything at the end of the year. My priorities shifted a ton since last Dec/Jan, and seeing such a daunting goal still looming in front of me on things like my weight loss made me just stop trying at all.

So! Let's set these achievable goals, and see if we can do any better this year.

### Long-Term Goal: Lose Weight, Get Healthier

#### Q1 Goal: Lose 6 lbs. in Q1

2 pounds every month. I'm itching to bump it up to 9 lbs., but I don't wanna get ahead of myself. More water, maybe a few less cookies, and this will be EASILY achievable.

#### Q1 Goal: Make 6 new recipes in Q1

I [wrote a few weeks ago](http://niclake.me/recipes/) about how I'm going to be tracking all of my recipes in 2020. Ready to put this notebook to good use.

### Long-Term Goal: Continue to Improve My Software Dev Skills

#### Q1 Goal: Create a New "Backlog Dreadsheets" Site

If you've been around my site before, you've probably seen my [video game][gamesSheet] or [books][booksSheet] backlog spreadsheets. While these are fine, they're really bulky & inelegant solutions. Also, now that I've started a new job & started working with a new language (Ruby/Rails), I'm trying to find little projects that I can do to help me learn quicker.

To that end, I'll be working to develop a site to track all of these. Should be pretty straightforward, a nice learning opportunity, and it'll allow me to have everything sorted exactly how I want. Wins all around.

And speaking of these backlogs...

### Long-Term Goal: Work Through My Various Backlogs

#### Q1 Goal: Beat 2 Video Games

#### Q1 Goal: Read 2 Books

I've had a book sitting on my nightstand for a few months now, and just got 4 more for Christmas. Maybe it's time I open them. I've also got a myriad of games installed on my PC for years. I need to actually launch them and beat them.

### Long-Term Goal: Write More

#### Q1 Goal: Write 6 Blog Posts

This is the one I'm actually going to push myself on. Not only do I have to write 6 posts, but they're not game review posts or anything like that. Actual content, things that I actually thing need to be said or logged for posterity.

That's it! 6 goals for Q1. Keeping them small, simple, and achievable. I want to blow past all of these goals, and give myself the motivation to either stretch these for Q2, or open up to some different goals in the spring.

*What goals do you have for yourself? Are you planning to do monthly or quarterly goals this year? Need someone to check in with you and keep you motivated? [Hit me up on Twitter][twitter] and let me know!*
