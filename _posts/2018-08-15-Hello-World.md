Well, I did it. I created yet another blog.

I'm not really sure what the entire point of doing this is yet. Part of me is disillusioned with Twitter. Part of me just wanted a domain to work on some small personal projects, like [converting my games to play spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zg-SOYI8DlH-ibSNslfPtq0xJB4sEMb_7OHKbq2qclk/edit?usp=sharing) into something more readable.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to getting this site up and running. Thanks for stopping by.
