Be honest, how many of you forgot I had a blog?[^1]

My gaming has been a bit sparse as of late. A few life changes, a few game changes, and... my wife and I bought our first house!

This post isn't going to be abnormally long, because we have **Pok√©mon Let's Go** to play, but I just wanted to make this post and let everyone know that yes, I still exist, and yes, I'm going to be reviewing more games here in the future. Should be a good time.

*Normally I'd put some boilerplate here about how you can harass me about my opinions on the games I review, but today you can't do that. [Message me on Twitter anyway][twitter] and let's chat!*

[^1]: I did.
