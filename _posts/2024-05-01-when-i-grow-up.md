title: "When I Grow Up"

I remember the very first thing I wanted to be when I grew up - the person pouring the water at our local Chinese restaurant.

They made it an absolute art form; taking your glass, starting close but then holding the pitcher and glass a mile apart. Didn't spill a drop. I was _fascinated_ by this, and always drank a ton of water whenever we went there because I wanted to watch them pour more water.

I wonder what the starting salary for "water pourer" is in 2024. Maybe a career change is in order.

I do know that when I was 4, I walked over to my mom's piano (she was a piano teacher) and started poking at the keys. She asked, "do you want to learn how to play?" and I apparently said yes. I then played piano until I was 17.

I know when I was 10, I got my first drum set, followed not long after by a bass and a guitar. I wanted to be a professional musician for ages; I was in a touring band for a while that made money, and I _almost_ got a gig with arguably the most popular artist in music right now back before their 2nd album released.[^1] So close.

[^1]: I was told that I was "too short". Which, fair. I'm 5'6", and said artist is 5'10".

In high school, I got enamored with marching band, and decided I wanted to be a music ed major so I could teach drumline at a huge Texas high school.

After injury took me out of music, I decided to pursue my love of computers with a computer science major. That rapidly pivoted to an information systems management degree after being convinced by some other classmates (I still don't know if this was the "better" desicion, but it worked out.)

Along the way, I know I've wanted to be a lot of different things; 3rd baseman for the Red Sox, author, sports journalist, video game developer, games journalist, sports statistician, Apple tech journalist (I really had a thing for journalism for a bit), iOS software developer (still want this), TTRPG module writer (aka D&D campaigns), Apple developer, brewer/brewery owner, woodworker, and most recently, electrical engineer.
