It's no secret that I'm very proud of my (currently) 152 sobriety streak. I'm someone that has a hard time committing to anything long-term, so being able to keep that up has been great.

When you read this post, it'll be May 31st (or later). Today is the final day of Weblog Posting Month, or [WeblogPoMo](/categories#WeblogPoMo). I'd been going strong all month, coming up with topics out of nowhere & knocking out tons of blog posts, even on days I really didn't feel like it.

And then yesterday, right before dinner, my daughter injured herself. (Everything's ok - she had about 2 dozen splinters of various size in her hand. We tried to extract them last night, failed, hoped they'd come out on their own overnight, they didn't, so we went to urgent care this morning.)

Suffice to say, I didn't get a post written last night. I had a good topic, but that'll just have to wait until later.

But I realized... **I felt an *extraordinary* amount of guilt for missing a day.** Self-imposed guilt for sure, but damn, I was gonna have to miss a day. And that sucks.

I track my daily water consumption. I am learning Japanese and Spanish using an app. I keep a task list that includes things I need to check off every day. I'm logging the days I don't drink alcohol. *And absolutely none of these things have good ways to handle a missed day* - falling off the wagon, if you will. Being derailed from your intended tasks.

People have been asking Apple for *years* to give you a way to press pause on your streak of closing your Activity rings. People get sick. Get injured. Have a death in the family. Shit comes up, and they're worried about losing a 2,000+ day streak that nobody sees.

Society has been set up to gameify everything that we do as a means for encouraging success. And at a certain point, even I (who lives for that stuff) have to wonder if this is doing more harm than good.

Proud Dad Moment #1: when we were extracting the splinters, V was *screaming*. Pain, confusion, the whole gamut. But when we'd say "just let me see it" or "can I get you anything?", she would consistently scream out through tears "NO THANK YOU!" I joke all the time "wow, how did we get such a polite little girl?" I know it's all about how we raise her, and she sees that come from us, so I feel good that I'm modeling the behavior for her... but I'm so proud that she's latched on to that. She's so funny, kind, polite, and loving. Just the best.

Proud Dad Moment #2: I know that having an authority figure step in to take those splinters out is a different experience than having Mom or Dad do it, but she was an absolute trooper. The first half dozen or so came out with no complaints at all; the remainder, we'd take real short breaks to reset, and she'd calm right down and say "ok, ready".

Proud Dad Moment #3: we left urgent care, realized we'd not had any coffee yet, so went to the coffee shop that's right next door. V sees the clinic out her window and goes "thank you so much, bye bye!"

I don't care about winning any World's Best Dad awards, because I've already got the world's best kid.
