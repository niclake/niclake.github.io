Blog post ideas:
	Competitive (why I felt like I had to get Gold, why I continue to play competitive games instead of my backlog)
	Something about how music is no longer fun for me
	Creating things, either music or wanting to do woodworking/3d printing stuff
	End of year music lists (posting in reverse order)
		Top 10 albums
		Singles, stand-out songs, and things I missed last year
		All the other albums

Update site layout
	Try to make footnotes work more like Marco's
