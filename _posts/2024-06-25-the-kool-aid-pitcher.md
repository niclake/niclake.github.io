On March 19, 2024, I sent a very excited message to my friends:

> *âœ… ADHD med prescription*

With a toddler running around the house, attempting to white-knuckle my way through life when I *knew* my brain would not let me concentrate on stuff was just no longer an option. I've suspected that I'd had some sort of ADD or ADHD since 2006, and it's taken me nearly 20 years to finally seek out a true screening, diagnosis, and prescription.

> *Quick aside/caveat - what I refer to, and what many of you know, as "ADHD" as actually "Attention Deficit Disorder - Hyperactive Type". I've had someone come for me about this previously, so I just wanted to clear that up. Ok, back to it.*

When I tell you that my prescription has changed **EVERYTHING** about my life, I am not kidding. It's now extremely rare for me to get off-task... sometimes to my detriment.

I've realized that taking the time to truly understand not only how my brain is functioning, but why it's functioning in that way, is important to me growing with this and learning how to manage. The medication is a tool for me, but I need a whole arsenal at my disposal to make sure I'm well equipped to better understand, but also to help others around me (like my family) understand me as well.

I use analogies a lot for things, because visualizing something helps me latch on to it better[^1], and also seems to work better for explaining it. But sometimes they get weird, like this one.

[^1]: If you ever tell me where something is, like "oh just go down Aisle 7, and it'll be on the top shelf on your left", you'll probably see me close my eyes - I'm attempting to picture it in my head, because having any sort of repetition that isn't you telling me the thing makes it lock in more solidly for me.

## My brain is like a Kool-Aid pitcher

You know the ones I'm talking about. Tall, not too wide, frosted but you can still see what's inside. That's my brain.

- I have a very finite amount of space in that pitcher. I can't just go to the store and get a second one, or a bigger one. What I've got is what I've got.
- A big task will occupy the entire container. So, whatever I'm doing for work? Pour it in. Fill it up.
- As long as nothing jostles the container, it doesn't matter if it's stuffed to the brim. Once it's in there, and everything is peaceful, I'm good.
- When I'm all done with that task, I (metaphorically) pick up the pitcher, take it to the sink, and dump it out. Great. Time to reset and fill it back up.
- If someone/something comes along and jostles that pitcher, things spill. If they pick it up and say "no sorry you have to do this now" and dump it out, I have no idea what to do, and my brain starts to flip out. Same thing if someone comes along with a new project and says "here do this" and just unceremoniously adds it to my current flow - everything gets mixed together, things overflow out the top, and I have to regulate/let the fluid settle before being able to accomplish anything else.
- If my pitcher is NOT 100% full, my brain does everything in its power to fill it. This is usually to my detriment.
- To that end, if I'm doing something that's not super demanding of my attention (say, grocery shopping), I can fill it with something else (like a podcast), and I'm golden; the pitcher is topped off like a black & tan. We're good.
- To THAT end[^2], some tasks are what I call "low density". Repeat watching of a TV show or a movie is a perfect example. It's easily displaced by things. And, they're not super demanding tasks on top of that, so now I've got a half full pitcher of light density stuff. If my brain fills it with, say, doomscrolling on the web (a very "high density" task), now I'm at risk of continuing to fill and fill and fill until all of the low density stuff has been shoved out (the TV is still on but I haven't looked at it in over an hour) by all the high density stuff (oh god what the fuck did Trump do today? *scroll scroll scroll*).

Now, given all of that, I've realized that the ADHD meds help me in 2 very specific ways:

- First, they help me care less about the empty space in my pitcher. Normally, even when I'd be writing a post like this, I'd still have music on to listen to as background noise. Currently, I don't have anything else going. I'm ~80% capacity and doing just fine, thank you.
- Second, it helps stabilize the pitcher even more on the table. Things that might've bumped into it and caused spillage now just bounce off (this can be both good and bad). Part of that is because, if the pitcher is not at max capacity, there's more room for sloshing. The other part is just that I'm more focused on whatever is in front of me, so you can't "Oh yeah!" your way into my brain as easily.
- That said, the "help" can also be a hinderance, as I'm laser focused on whatever is the "high density" thing in my pitcher, whether I want that to be my focus or not.

[^2]: Sorry, the analogy gets messy. Bear with me.

If you read this far, thank you. It truly does mean a lot. Writing things like this out is a form of therapy for me[^3], and if even one other person feels person feels enlightened by this, I'd consider it a huge win.

[^3]: Actual therapy is better - y'all should try it. It's great.
