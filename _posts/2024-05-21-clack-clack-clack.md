I remember randomly discovering [Reddit's mechanical keyboards subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards) about 10-11 years ago. I thought, "wow, what the heck, why would you buy custom keyboards?" I remember a year later, randomly seeing the [GMK Nautilus keycap set](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-zambumon-gmk-nautilus-custom-keycap-set), and thinking "hmm, ok, I guess I could get behind that... but then I'd have to get a keyboard to put it on". And now here I am, neck deep in the mechanical keyboard hobby, having just had some parts delivered this morning for the 2nd unbuilt board in my drawer.

At the highest level, a mechanical keyboard is... well, just a nicer keyboard. You can customize a lot of different things based on what you purchase; caps can be different heights and made of different materials, the switches can move smoothly or have a tactile feel to them, the cases can be light as a feather or heavy as a rock, and all of that can contribute to the feel of typing on it & the sound that it makes. Also, they can look pretty.

Here's a look at my collection (boards are listed from the photo, top to bottom, left to right):

### Left column

- **DZ60 + Tofu acrylic case, Zaku linear switches, DSA "UnAlice" keycaps**: This is what's considered a 60% keyboard, meaning there are no arrow keys, no numpad, and no function keys. This is what I consider to be my "default" layout. "Well Nic, how do you move around with no arrows?" After I list my boards, I'll explain more about my default setup for most of these boards. (Also, if you look at this and think "wow, Nic, your letters are in the wrong spots", [there's a reason for that](https://niclake.me/colemak).)
- **Boardwalk + KBDfans 5Â° aluminum case, Zaku II tactile switches, KAT Cyberspace keycaps**: This was my first true custom board; everything else that I'd purchased up until this point was a prebuilt. It is an ortholinear keyboard, meaning that all of the keys are lined up horizontally and vertically. The aluminum case, plus the brass plate holding switches in place, makes this a very pingy & loud board to type on.
- **Mode Sonnet, BSUN Strawberry Wine linear switches, ~~KAT Space Dust~~ random purple keycaps**: The board I'm currently typing on. I got this used from a friend, and this is truly one of my favorite boards to type on. It's smooth, fast, and the sound is incredible. These should have some cool black/blue/pink keycaps on them, but they're currently mired in transportation woes after one of the longest group buys in keyboard history; last I checked, they had been sent back to China because they'd been shipped to the US in a container with illegal cotton (seriously).
- **Planck, BSUN Pine tactile switches, KAT Explosion keycaps**: A 40% board (aka no number row). If you aren't a keyboard person, you're probably looking at this thinking "how?!?" To type numbers, I hold down that up arrow to the right of the space to access the number layer (more on layers soon), and then 1-0 are on the standard ASDFGHJKL; keys. I have a lot of fun typing on this board.

### Right column

- **FoldKB (unbuilt), Gateron Yellow Pro linear switches, ??? keycaps**: I won this board at the most recent Iowa Mechanical Keyboard meetup in April, but I have yet to assemble it. This will be my first "solder everything into place" board; up till now, I've been using boards that have hotswap sockets, letting me easily change out switches on the fly.
- **Promenade + Tofu Redux case, Gateron Raw linear switches, KAM Command keycaps**: My most recent build. This is a clone of the Boardwalk, since the company behind that board is no longer in existence, but this one allows me to easily have the taller keys in the center column. I need a replacement "J" key, which is en route from China (they forgot to include a "normal" J in the box for people who don't use QWERTY layouts).
- **Elora + custom walnut cases, Kailh Box Heavy Yellow linear switches, GMK Dots 2 keycaps**: My first split keyboard, one that I've been excited about for a long time. In the photo, they're sitting up on their sides in order to fit in with the shelf; [this is a better example of how the keyboard would look on my desk](https://splitkb.com/cdn/shop/files/Keyboard_3_1620x1080.jpg). This is an ergonomic layout, meant to reduce stress on your fingers and wrists by allowing you to get the halves of the board in an optimal position for each user.
- **Alpha28, Cherry MX Speed Silver linear switches, generic black keycaps**: Someone was giving this away at the Iowa meetup. I've ensured that it functions, but haven't done anything more than that yet; I'm saving it for the Relay.fm St. Jude campaign this fall as a stretch goal for someone's fundraiser (I'll have to use it exclusively for a week).
- **Bully, Gateron Oil King linear switches, SA Mizu keycaps**: I love this little board a lot; a standard stagger-layout 40% board, it's a bit of a challenge to type on at times, but once I get in the groove with things, it's another favorite typing experience.

![My Planck keymap][planck]

I mentioned earlier how I have "layers" on all of these boards; layers are a pretty standard option when it comes to mechanical keyboards, and something that I make extensive use of, especially on smaller boards. Above is a view of my Planck's keymap.

- Note that the key that's normally where Caps Lock would be is orange; if I hold that down, and press any key with orange text in the upper left (ex: my N key has the down arrow), it will input that instead. Similarly, the blue key w/ the down arrow corresponds to the numbers on my home row.
- I also use what is called [Space Cadet Shifts](https://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/#s17-shift-parentheses), which functions as something called a "ModTap"; essentially, if I hold the key down, it functions as a standard Shift key. But if I just tap it instead, it inputs the ( or ) keys (depenging on left or right shift being pressed). As a software developer, I make extensive use of parentheses, so having easy access to this is wonderful.
- Additionally, I also use Key Combos a lot. You can see the small yellow keys bridging the full sized ones on my layout; those mean that when I press the two keys simultaneously, it will instead output the displayed key (ex: I press X + C to output `, or C + V for ~). While I mainly implemented this for use on my tiny keyboards, I've gotten so used to these over time that I've implemented all of these combos on all of my boards, even the bigger ones.

There's a lot to the world of mechanical keyboards, and the rabbit hole can go *really* deep. Some people (like my wife) look at the keycaps and go "oh those look nice", and that's all they care about. Other people are focused on the quality of materials, including [boards that have custom accent pieces underneath where you can't see them](https://modedesigns.com/pages/loop-tkl) (that's a bit much for me, personally).

Do you have a keyboard collection? I'd love to see it!
