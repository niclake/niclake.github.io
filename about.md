This is the website & blog of **Nic Lake**, a 30-something tech enthusiast, gamer & streamer, musician, sports fan, home brewer & craft beer snob, husband, and cat dad living in Des Moines, IA.

I spend my days working as a full-stack web developer & project manager for a development shop, working mostly with Ruby on Rails. Previously, I've also worked as business analyst on an AR/VR team for a major manufacturing company, and as a software developer for industry leaders in health care, non-profit fund-raising, insurance, banking, and public transportation.

I spend my nights and weekends partaking in a variety of hobbies. Video games are a major passion of mine, and you can find me [streaming on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/PhoenixUNI) on occasion. I'm always looking for additional games to add to my [never-ending list of games to play](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zg-SOYI8DlH-ibSNslfPtq0xJB4sEMb_7OHKbq2qclk/edit?usp=sharing). I'm also a multi-instrumental musician, and I've [released an EP under the name *The Music Plays You*](http://themusicplaysyou.bandcamp.com). When I'm not partaking in those, you can also find me bartending at [the best brewery in Des Moines](http://www.confluencebrewing.com), reading (or at least updating my [books to read](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-1PcHF6xzFKTaTvxnfjm6bVgo4pd5yIr3nbxsbckoFo/edit?usp=sharing)), watching Boston-based sports teams, cooking, or making yet another spreadsheet.

This website was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
