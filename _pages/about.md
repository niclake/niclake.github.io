I'm Nic Lake. My pronouns are he/him.

### Professional

I am a lead software engineer at [Stitch Fix](https://stitchfix.com), an online personal styling service based in San Francisco, CA.

I've spent over a dozen years writing code for a wide variety of industries with a wide variety of tech stacks, as well as a detour as a business analyst. I currently work mostly with Ruby on Rails, React, and GraphQL.

I graduated from the [University of Northern Iowa](https://uni.edu) with a degree in Management Information Systems. This was not my first choice, but I'm thankful every day for the path that led me there.

### Personal

I have an ever growing list of hobbies, including video games, reading, mechanical keyboards, woodworking, watching the Celtics and Red Sox, cooking, and making yet another spreadsheet. I have [a full sleeve Pok√©mon tattoo](/tattoos), and a few others on my other arm. I type using the [Colemak layout](/colemak). I hack at [various small projects](/projects) from time to time.

In a previous life, I was an accomplished musician. I started playing piano at age 4, drums at 10, bass at 12, and guitar at 13. I started my college career as a music education major, with the aspiration of teaching drumline at a 5/6A high school in Texas (oddly specific, I know). I missed out on being the lead guitarist for the most popular recording artist of the early 2020's because she's 4 inches taller than me. I released [an EP of ambient instrumental music](/sailing) in 2013.

My partner (R), our daughter (V), and our cats (Bearcat and Beau) reside in eastern Iowa, USA.
