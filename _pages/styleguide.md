This is a style guide for [NicLake.me](/).

This site's theme is built around the Dracula color scheme, with the following variables & usage:

<div class="container color-container">
  <div class="row">
    {% for color in site.data.colors %}
      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 d-flex align-items-stretch">
        <div class="card color-box">
          <div class="the-color" style="background-color: {{color.hex}};">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="mt-2 mb-auto">
            <div><strong>{{color.name}} ({{color.variable}})</strong></div>
            <div><strong>Hex</strong>: {{color.hex}}</div>
            <div><strong>RGB</strong>: {{color.rgb}}</div>
            <div><strong>Usage</strong>: {{color.usage}}</div>
          </div>

***Here is some bolded & emphasized text.***

Here is some text with a footnote[^1].

Lists are done by appending with a symbol like `*` or `-` for unordered lists, or `1.` for numbered lists:

* Example of an unordered list.
* Another line.
- A third line w/ a different symbol

1. Example of an ordered list.
2. Another line.

You do not need to increment your numbered lists if you do not want to:

1. First element
1. Second element, even though it's a `1`

Below is a horizontal rule:

---

Here is [an example inline link](google.com), and here is [an example link w/ organized URLs][orglink].

[orglink]: yahoo.com

If you want to have some inline code, wrap in single backticks, like this: `google.com`.

If you want to use a code block, wrap everything in triple backticks:

```
for (i=0, i<10, i++) { print i; }
```

You should follow the initial line of backticks with the appropriate language for syntax highlighting:

```ruby
class CrazyPass < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :api_client
  belongs_to :auto_renewed_from, class_name: "CrazyPass", optional: true

  scope :active, -> {
    where(canceled_at: nil).where(auto_renewed_at: nil).where("expiration_date >= ?", Time.current.beginning_of_day)
  }

  AUTO_RENEWED = :auto_renewed
  RENEW = "renew".freeze

  validate :presence_of_auto_renew
  validate :client_can_only_have_one_crazy_pass
  validate :valid_absurd_transaction_request_state
  validates_presence_of :client_id
  after_create :generate_insanity_renewal

  def self.auto_renew_candidates
    CrazyPass.auto_renew_first_charge_candidates.or(CrazyPass.auto_renew_second_charge_candidates)
  end
end
```

Inline quotes look as follows:

> Apple Watch Series 9 is powered by custom Apple silicon in the all-new S9 SiP. Appleâ€™s most powerful watch chip yet delivers systemwide improvements and brand-new features, including a new double tap gesture and on-device Siri with the ability to access and log health data privately and securely. Apple Watch Series 9 also has a new 4-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast, when compared with Apple Watch Series 8. The power efficiency of the S9 SiP allows Apple Watch Series 9 to maintain all-day 18-hour battery life.  

Multi-line quotes require 2 spaces after each line:

> Here we are  
> sitting on the couch  
> the cats are snoring  
> stink breath  

Table example:

| Standard align | Left Align | Center Align | Right Align |
|---|:--|:-:|--:|
| Sample of a standard align cell | Sample of a left align cell | Sample of a center align cell | Sample of a right align cell |

Images can be put in like this:

{% include image.html
  src="hats/hats.jpg"
  alt="The current collection of hats"
  caption="From left to right: my non-sports related hats, my non-Red Sox sport hats, and all of my Red Sox hats, plus some beanies in the back."
%}

{% include image.html
  src="hats/redsoxhat.png"
  position="right"
%}

You can use `position` to place an image left or right of the content, and `caption` to add a text caption below the image. If being positioned left/right, you should place the image block before the content.

The full template for using `_include/image.html`:

{% raw %}

```liquid
{% comment %}
  src: The local path to the image; assumes images/
  srcabs: The external URL of the image (Imgur, etc.)
  url: The URL clicking the link will take you to
{% endcomment %}

{% include image.html
  src="theFilePathInImages"
  srcabs="theExternalImageURL"
  url="theURLClickingTheImageTakesYouTo"
  alt="TheAltText"
  caption="TheCaption"
  position="left|right"
%}
```

{% endraw %}
