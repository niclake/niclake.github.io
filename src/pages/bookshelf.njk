<p>A whole bunch of people on the internet have started to have bookshelves and almanacs on their websites, such as <a href="https://rknight.me/almanac/">Robb Knight</a>, <a href="https://bobmonsour.com/books/">Bob Monsour</a>, and <a href="https://thisguise.wtf/bookshelf/">Chazz Basuta</a>. I love this idea; I've had aspirations to do something similar for ages, but I've always managed to just fall back on linking to my Goodreads or <a href="">StoryGraph</a> profiles, or just pointing people towards <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-1PcHF6xzFKTaTvxnfjm6bVgo4pd5yIr3nbxsbckoFo/edit?usp=sharing">my reading spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>Now, though, I'm going to do better about showing all of my data more publicly, so that people can follow along with what I'm reading, and see the things I would recommend.</p>

<div class="container card-container">
  <div class="catalog-years">
    {% for year in catalog.books.years %}
      <div class="btn-nl-primary">
        <a href="#{{ year.year }}" class="tag-bubble">{{ year.year | replace("y", "") }}</a>{% if  not loop.last %} {% endif %}
      </div>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
  <div class="center-heading catalog-year">
    <h2 id="current" class="bookyear">Currently Reading</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    {%- for book in catalog.books.current %}
      {% include "bookitem.njk" %}
    {%- endfor %}
  </div>

  {% set previous_year = "" %}
  {%- for book in catalog.books.datedBooks %}
    {%- set current_year = book.compDate | truncate(4, true, '') -%}
    {%- if current_year != previous_year %}
      {% if not loop.first %}</div>{% endif %}
      <div class="center-heading catalog-year">
        <h2 id="y{{ current_year }}">{{ current_year }}</h2>
      </div>
      {% set previous_year = current_year %}
      <div class="row">
    {%- endif %}
    {% include "bookitem.njk" %}
  {%- endfor %}

  <div class="center-heading catalog-year">
    <h2 id="undated">Undated</h2>
    <span>Books that I've read that I don't have a completion date for.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    {%- for book in catalog.books.undatedBooks %}
      {% include "bookitem.njk" %}
    {%- endfor %}
