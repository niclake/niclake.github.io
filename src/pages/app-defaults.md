Browsing blogs, I've seen a bunch of people that have been inspired by [Hemispheric Views episode 97](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) and [Robb Knight](https://defaults.rknight.me/) to share their app defaults. It's a great way of learning more about a person & discovering new apps, so I figured why not.

[^1]: I just cannot get used to the Action Button on my phone. I never use it. It just sits there, abandoned. Poor thing.
