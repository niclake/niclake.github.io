Browsing blogs, I've seen a bunch of people that have been inspired by [Hemispheric Views episode 97](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) and [Robb Knight](https://defaults.rknight.me/) to share their app defaults. It's a great way of learning more about a person & discovering new apps, so I figured why not.
