What a week.

I was going to write a long post, but exhaustion has been pushing me into bed for the past 2 hours, so I'm going to summarize in a few key points.

1) Got into a lovely internet spat with someone when I asked him to define the definition of his religious beliefs (or lack thereof).  That drama seemed to consume the first half of the week. 2) Dominated classes, homework, and work.  My new trick is getting through 5pm Wed.  My night class at 5:30 rocks.  (Oh crap, I have a quiz this week... better write that down.) 3) Started dating a nice girl.  About time.  (We'll call her A here on the blog... so she has some semblance of anonymity.)

Then Thursday night hit.

I decided to hang out with A Thursday night... you know, since we were actually dating and all.  I only have 2 classes Friday, and didn't have much going on, so I figured that would be ok.  Well, here's how that turned out...

\- Got to bed at 3:30am Friday. - 9 and 10am class Friday. - Lunch with Bryce, plus fixing his router. - Hanging out with A, her roommates, and her friend the rest of the day, plus driving a visiting RA over to the wellness center so she didn't get lost. - Fell asleep at 1am Saturday. - Woke up at 1:15pm Saturday, for a 2pm tech call at Prairie Lakes Church. - At church for Saturday service from 2-7pm. - Still awake, so I didn't go to bed until 1:30am Sunday. - Woke up at 6am, to get to church for 2 morning services @ 9 and 11. - Set up for the evening college ministry service, by myself. - Practice @ 4, dinner @ 5:30, service @ 6:15 to 7:30ish. - Teardown, general socializing, and driving home by 8:30.

My feet hurt.  I'm exhausted, both physically and mentally.

And yet, I wouldn't give any of it up for anything.  Except maybe the internet spat.  I was way too involved this weekend, I know this now, and I plan on not trying to be the new super hero around the church... but I had a blast, I got to learn some great stuff, play some music with some awesome musicians, worship, and feel a lot more accomplished than if I'd just been sitting around my room.  To serve others in any capacity, be it religious or not, is a very rewarding feeling.

Now for sleep.
