Everyone always tells you "think outside the box". As a musician, this can be really helpful, or extremely frustrating. We all have our own ruts that we like to sit in, certain licks we enjoy, specific instruments and pedals and amps that we want to play through, and so forth. Sometimes, mixing things up a bit can really motivate a musician to become better. Give the classical pianist a jazz chart. Have that metal-head guitarist play some blues. Give an old, beaten up trumpet to the orchestra's first chair, and have him struggle and strive to make every note sound exactly how he wants it.

While those are all well and good, why do you have to be proficient at every aspect of your discipline? Some people have this natural ability, or have worked for many hours in order to accomplish this feat, but does it mean we all have to? While I agree that it's good to get out of the box every once in a while, I prefer to use my box as a pedestal. Stand upon it, higher than everyone else, and own that content underneath your feet.

The same can be said of life and the working world. There's a reason certain aspects of work get delegated to different employees, why the President has so many advisors, and why you have multiple teachers when you hit junior high on up. Â There's no shame in not knowing everything. There's no shame in asking for help and guidance from those more knowledgable than you. And there's definitely no shame in pursuing the things that interest you. But you have to be willing to return the favor, and you have to have the motivation to strive for excellence in what it is that you do. You have to be willing to be the beacon of light, the wise one, the guru in that field.

Strive for excellence. Be yourself. And own that box.
