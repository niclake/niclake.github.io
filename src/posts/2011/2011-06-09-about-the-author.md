I have a tendancy to over-share. Mostly because I like to imagine that people actually give a crap about me, who I am, and what I like to do.  That's why <a href="http://blog.niclake.com/colophon/" target="_blank">my colophon</a> is as lengthy as it is. And trust me, that was pruned. A lot.

Oh well. Without further ado, here's some random facts about me:

- I've only broken digits; ring/pinky fingers on each hand (stroller collapsed, and a window slammed shut on them. Both when I was 2 or younger), and my right big toe (dropped a server on it, while I wasn't wearing my metatarsal steel-toed boots).
- I'm a 2-time State of Iowa piano champion, and a 2-time All-State percussionist. Yes, I am really that good.
- I've had a letter <a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/photos-ak-ash1/v162/68/56/38206727/n38206727_33038619_6695.jpg" target="_blank">published in Sports Illustrated</a>.
- My middle name is Julien.  I feel extremely weird sharing this.
- I've built a house in Mexico, and I've pissed in Canada.
- I like clocks. I have at least 7 or 8 in my room, and wouldn't mind increasing that number.
- My favorite instruments to listen to are the cello and french horn.
- I have a strange fascination with the mythological phoenix, and the symbolism tied to it.
- I can't remember names well, but number-related things (like dates and phone numbers) stick to me like glue. This can be unfortunate at times, and has saved my ass in others.
- I gave a kid a bloody nose in kindergarten because he took my coat hanging spot. We became best friends through high school.
- I currently have no tattoos or piercings. Used to have a pierced ear. Want to get that back. Also want to get a phoenix (there it is again) tattooed on my right forearm, with its tail wrapping up the bicep and across my shoulder blades.
