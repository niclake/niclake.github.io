Every time I make a purchase from the Apple Store, I'm always pleasantly surprised. They take my email address, and before I've even made it out the front door, a receipt is in my inbox. This is great for a number of reasons:

- Less for me to worry about. No accidentally throwing away important things.
- I can dump the email into a specific folder for receipts, export it to an app like Evernote, or countless other things.
- If I ever need to find it, a quick search pulls it up.

It took me about 5 seconds to pull up information regarding all of my devices (iPhone, iPod Classic, MBA, iMac, and my long-gone iPad), as well as all of my app purchases that I've made. Coupled with things like <a href="http://whowritesforyou.com/2011/12/19/it-feels-like-trust-the-apple-store-app-and-self-checkout/" target="_blank">Randy's recent experience in the Apple Store</a>, and you can see how easy the shopping experience is becoming.

This contrasts sharply with places like my local grocery store (at which I've worked, and also work for their corporate IT team), where the purchase of 1 item will get you a receipt a good 2 feet long. Senseless information, requests for surveys that no one ever fills out, and other pointless crap. Obviously, the importance of holding onto a receipt for a pound of bananas is not nearly the same as my iMac, but I'm making a point here.

The "cool thing" right now is the GTD movement and reducing clutter in your lives, and going paperless is one of the keys to many people and businesses. Strange, then, that we've let something like receipts slip through the crack, simply because they're a norm. Why do I have to be surprised to find out that Company XYZ will email me my receipt? Why can't THAT be the norm, or at least an acceptable standard?

On my desk right now, I have the following:

- Mediacom bill
- Sprint bill
- Insurance bill
- Amazon.com Visa card bill

Every single one of those are paid online. All but 1 of those (insurance) have automatic payments established, and are sending me these papers as a "courtesy receipt".

No. No no no no no. And more no.

Companies are concerned about being green, about reducing clutter, about making the customer's experience better. I realize that not everyone out there has a computer or internet that they access daily, or even weekly. But giving consumers an option to go paperless should be a standard, not an afterthought.
