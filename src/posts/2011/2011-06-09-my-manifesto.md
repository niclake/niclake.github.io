- Don't worry.
- Time is precious. Make the most of it.
- You won't know if you don't ask.
- Less is more, and more is a waste.
- You set your own standards for greatness.
- Always make time for family and friends.
- Adventure is the spice of life.
- Do it yourself. No one else will.

An evolving list, but this is where I stand right now.
