Back in October 2010, I purchased the iPad. I thought it would be a perfect fit, the total complement to my 27" iMac sitting on my desk; having a small-ish device that gave me the ability to read blogs, check email and Twitter, and entertain myself with games and movies while on the go.

I was wrong, but not in the way I expected.

Don't get me wrong, *I love the iPad*. It was definitely used far more than my 17" HP laptop. I took notes for class (albeit very abbreviated ones), watched Netflix and MLB.TV while at work, kept up to date with everything my friends were posting, and so on. It was, and is, the ultimate CONSUMPTION device, in that I could consume any and all content that I wanted to take in.

Unfortunately, that didn't cut it for me. The majority of my iPad usage came when I was at work. For me (yay, college), work is my study time. Taking business and graphic design classes, I had to write more papers, do more research and design more posters than I care to think about. The iPad was just not cutting it in terms of being a PRODUCTIVE device, where I could write and design things. (Yes, I know that there are some crazy people like Patrick Rhone that are writing entire books on their iPads and iPhones, and that's awesome. It works for them. Not for me.)

A couple things happened simultaneously at the beginning of May. First, a bunch of people that I respect began acquiring MacBook Airs to use in their day-to-day lives. Some got them as complements to their current setups. Others purchased them to be used as their primary and/or only computer. Across the board, I heard nothing but positive things. At the same time, I went out on a limb and posted the HP laptop on a technology forum's classified ads. The iPad was also listed, but only under the stipulation that the HP sold first. Within minutes, I had a request from a gentleman to buy both.

So I took a chance; I pulled the trigger and purchased a 13", 128GB HD, 4GB RAM Air, just in time for me to start heading out on the road for work. Even when I'm home on the weekends, I still find myself utilizing the Air as my primary machine. Even if I'm sitting in my desk chair, it's the feeling of being able to be *both free & productive* that I love.

The limited space forces me to think about exactly what I want on the computer. No Flash (I have Chrome and an <a href="http://blog.niclake.com/2011/06/safari-tab-in-chrome-applescript/" target="_blank">Applescript to open the current Safari tab in Chrome</a> if I need it), no music (I carry my iPod Classic everywhere). Only the apps that I use (56 items in my Applications folder). Data stored in the cloud (via Dropbox and Simplenote). It's not "what I could potentially do", but rather the "what do I need to do?" mentality that is necessary to use this device.

Comparing the iMac and the Air is like comparing 2 elegant sports cars. Both are great to look at, fun to drive, and have their differences. The iMac will beat you senseless on the long straightaways, taking it's sweet time getting to top speed but then hauling ass once it does. The Air, on the other hand, will beat you in the short stretches and around the corners. For stop-and-go, in-town traffic, you'll both make it to the light at about the same time.

I highly recommend the Air, either as a main machine (many will need an external, but that's ok) or as a supplementary machine. It excels at either position, and is hands down my favorite computer that I've ever owned.
