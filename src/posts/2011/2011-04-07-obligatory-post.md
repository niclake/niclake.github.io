I really need to start blogging more.  Live has been super busy.  School, church, school, trying to have a social life, and more school.

13 months until I graduate. I'm nervous. I seriously don't know what I want to do with my life yet. Part of me wants to move to Des Moines, transforming my internship with Hy-Vee (with whom I'm working for again this summer) into a full-time gig. Part of me wants to head straight for a bigger city... Boston, Chicago, KC, Minneapolis, Nashville, etc. Find a job, somehow afford rent, and make music or something. Another part wants to stay here in Cedar Falls, though that part is definitely small. Yet another part wants to start a band and tour. I don't care if I get rich, I just want to explore the US (and world?), make music, and have fun. Seeing the success of some of my high school friends and acquaintances (Matt, Josh, Josh & Ben of [Former Thieves](http://www.myspace.com/formerthieves), and Steve of [Damiera](http://www.myspace.com/damiera)) really strengthens that desire.

My Red Sox are sucking up right now.  0-4? Not with this lineup.

Besides my travels for work this summer, I have plans to visit Detroit and (hopefully) Chicago.  The possibility of Kansas City is also there, and maybe Minneapolis as well.  I'm excited.

I miss my blogging friends.  Who of you still follow me?
