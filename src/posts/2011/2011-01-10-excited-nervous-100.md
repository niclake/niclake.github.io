Classes started up again today. I'm pumped that my schedule worked out like it did, only having classes on MWF. Wednesdays are going to suck, but that's ok, I can deal with it. The one thing I forgot, though, is the fact that I am now taking 100-level business courses.

Hoooooooooooooly crap.

I'm really excited about the things that I get to do, and what I'm going to learn over the course of the semester. That being said, I've never had the amount of work to do like I'm going to have on my plate this semester. Â Organizational Management is still up in the air. I have a brand new professor that has 25 years of real-world experience, but she's already assigned 2 chapters for reading (out of the book that hasn't shown up yet... bugger).

Systems Analysis and Design is going to be quite a bit different. Half the class points are based on a semester-long group project, one in which she assigns the group members instead of us picking them. It's a smaller class though, about 14 people, so I think there will be enough 1-on-1 time to make that ok.

And then Graphic Design... well, I've been designated the unofficial TA for the class already. Just under 3 hours of class every Monday and Wednesday, plus the time that we're going to need to put in for the projects that are assigned, leads me to believe that I'm going to need to start chugging coffee... both as a means to fit in with all the art students, as well as staying awake. I'm really pumped for this class, though. The professor seems like someone that will challenge us with various assignments, and it's actually stuff I'm interested in, so it's win win.

Kinda glad break is over now, actually. I drove 4,000 miles while working for Hy-Vee over the last 3 weeks, so that definitely cut into my vacation time. I'm sure the paychecks will make it worth it, though. (Also discovered that I really like Impalas.) Oh, and I gave myself a stress fracture when I slipped on the ice in the office's parking lot. Yeah, that's no fun.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but... it's time for me to hit the books and get started on some of this studying I've already been assigned. This feels really, really weird...
