From an early age, everyone is telling us "you should do what you love". How do we even begin to define that? Do we do what gives us the most joy? Do we do things that reward us with what gives us the most joy, like money? Do we do things that enable us to make lots of money, so that we can more easily pursue the things that give us joy?

I have a new definition I'd like to propose, one that works perfectly for those like me that either have multiple varied interests, or that are trying to determine what they want to do with their future. That definition is this: when you can work on it for hours on end, losing track of time and everything else around you, that's when you know you love it.

I've been working on getting this website up and running over the past couple of days (thanks again to <a href="http://ianhin.es" target="_blank">Ian Hines</a> for his assistance), and have found myself completely immersed in what I'm doing. I've struggled, but I'm kept pushing. I've hit roadblocks, so I've taken breaks and thought it through. I've had breakthroughs, and they just galvanize me to do more and more.

Perhaps this is just an extension of being in the zone, in my cave (<a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/07/10/a_nerd_in_a_cave.html" target="_blank">"A Nerd in a Cave"</a> by Michael Lopp). But I know me. I have a hard enough time focusing on something for 5 minutes, let alone the 6 hours I spent immersed in the work I was doing today. I rarely get into "the zone", and if I do, it's usually when I'm reading a book or playing guitar, rather than crafting something.

This is still a newly-discovered hobby of mine, and I won't even begin to speculate what the future holds. But I do know that if I could become that fully immersed in something as a career, I'd never complain about having an 8 to 5 job. Ever.
