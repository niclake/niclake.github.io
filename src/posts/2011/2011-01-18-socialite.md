What an awesome 10 days this has been.  Seriously.

I'm always excited for school to start back up, because that means people are back and we can hang out and such.  As shy as I might be around girls I like, I'm definitely an extrovert, and having those 3 weeks of working on the road was a huge shock for me.  So I was extremely pumped, because not only did I get back and get to hang out, but we added more people to our group.  Last semester was mostly just me, Steve (Otter), Andy, and Jason, with a smattering of Aaron and Andrew (Jamal).  Now, we've really seemed to add Andy's girlfriend Emily, Fred, and Emily's friends Jen and Drew.

I can't remember everything we've done since we've gotten here, but here's a smattering of the things I can remember:

- Hit up Buffalo Wild Wings
- Watched football
- Played "The Game of Things" and "Apples to Apples" a few times
- A couple impromptu NERF gun fights (plus a scheduled one I passed up in order to study)
- Watched The Hangover, Knocked Up, and Office Space
- Playing Wii (Mario Kart, Wii Sports, and Glee Karaoke... well, I played the first 2, and watched the 3rd)
- Also, unrelated to the group, spent 15 hours at my new church for a meeting, band practice, and 3 services on Saturday and Sunday.  All of which were incredible.

I'm pretty sure I'm missing things... or leaving them out intentionally.  Hah.

This is so unlike our dorm.  While it's labeled as a dorm for upperclassmen, it's really the dorm for antisocial people to retire to.  Having this many people actively participating in various activities on a whim is unheard of around here, and quite awesome.

Needless to say, I have yet to go to bed before midnight since I got back to school.  Being asleep by 2am is rare.  I was going to attempt that tonight, but I figured I'd blog instead.
