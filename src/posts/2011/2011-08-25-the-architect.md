The architect begins with a vision. Maybe it's an image of a building they want to create. Maybe it's the form and function of the building. Perhaps their ideas are radical enough to change how the world builds structures; lighter, cheaper materials, more energy efficient, and the like.

The building needs a lot of things to thrive. A solid foundation. Energy. A beautiful structure is always nice too. But without the vision, none of these things matter. Without a clearly defined vision, the building will be a hodgepodge of ideas, will probably lack the energy to supply it, and might overreach its foundation and come crumbling down.

Now imagine Steve Jobs is the architect, and Apple is the towering skyscraper.

Nothing has changed. The foundation has been laid. Energy is flowing throughout the entire company. The things that they create are stunning, beautiful, and radical. Jobs took the original Apple culture and flipped it on its head, and the vision and direction of the company is apparent to anyone who examines it. Just as an architect hands his finished plans and vision for a building off to the builders, so to is Jobs handing off Apple to Tim Cook and the other employees.

I understand that there's <a href="http://www.splatf.com/2011/08/steve-jobs-effect/" target="_blank">a huge difference between Apple pre-Jobs and with Jobs</a>. But assuming that we're going straight back into the pre-Jobs era with his hand-picked successor at the helm (and Jobs himself not far away) is just silly.

Claim Chowder: On Feb. 13, 2017, the day I turn 30 years old, Apple will still be here, will still be thriving, and will still be innovative pioneers of the technology world.
