Today, if you hit up Twitter and search for #PastBlast, you'll find a whole bunch of us tweeting some of our favorite articles that we've read over the years.  There is some wonderful stuff out there... Apple wishlists that turned out to be spot on, random stories about things like fonts in the NYC subway system or the SR-71 Blackbird aircraft, and much much more.

The best thing that happened today, in my world, was that I discovered [Ian Hines](http://ianhin.es/).  The articles that he's linked are marvelous, and skimming some of his other posts have been thought provoking.

One particular article of his struck home with me, especially the last paragraph.  I expressed my frustration as to the length of the paragraph, and how I really wanted to tweet that.  Ian's response?  "So reblog it."

[So I am](http://ianhin.es/wrote-about/being-yourself-online/).

Here's the line that really hit home with me:

> I think that if everyone stopped worrying about whether what they said was public, and starting thinking about whether they’d be embarrassed if it was, we might get both a more civilized Internet and a more understanding society.

Imagine a society that adhered to this statement, not only in our online presence, but in our daily lives.
