99.99% of the time, when life hits you with that left hook that spins you around (you spin my head right round, right roun... sorry), you hate it.  The other 0.01%, it's incredible, and you want to go get punched again.  I think I've gone the full 12 rounds with both tangents here recently.

\- A and I broke up.  Well, rather... I was a little chicken and ran away from A, because I didn't feel like I was in a good spot.  Correction, I WASN'T in a good spot to be dating.  She's not to thrilled about it, but I had to think for myself first on this one.

\- Been serving at the new church a lot these last 2 months.  What a blessing.  They're worried about "stretching me too far", but I'm loving every moment that I can get involved and help out.  (More on this in a bit.)

\- School is rough.  Extremely rough.  Busy busy busy busy I hate projects and midterms busy busy.  Haven't seen my friends Bryce and Zeke in a while, which sucks.  Haven't really seen too many of my friends outside of the dorms for a while, in fact.

\- My grandpa passed away on Friday.  First time I've lost someone truly close to me.  I lost an uncle and my dad's parents when I was younger, but I never truly knew them as an adult.  Grandpa was single-handedly the person that got me back into school, and as such has helped to propel me towards a better life.  I'm staying home for the funeral, since I feel he wouldn't want me to squander the opportunity he put me in here at school.  My parents are having a rough go of it, and I'm just trying to hang on to whatever solid points I can find at this point.

\- Discovered that I tend to shave my head when I get frustrated/depressed.

\- Started yet another blog.  I now write/curate 4 blogs:

• This one (congrats, you're here... no links or cookies for you!) • [The Dumping Ground](http://niclake.tumblr.com) - the title says it all • [Where'd The Music Go?](http://wheredthemusicgo.tumblr.com) - a blog highlighting what I deem to be quality music, since quality seems to be the last thing the industry cares about anymore (GIVE ME YOUR SUGGESTIONS, PEOPLE!!!!!!) • [Graffiti Sky](http://graffitisky.tumblr.com) - newest blog, started it tonight actually.  Religion musings.

I know some people that read my blog aren't the religious sort, or hold different beliefs than I do, and I respect that.  Everyone has a right to choose for themselves.  As such, most (all?) of my religious-related thoughts will be relegated to Graffiti Sky from here on out.

It's 2am.  I need sleep.  Just thought I'd update.
