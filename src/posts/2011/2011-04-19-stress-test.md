Today = me taking a study break to update.  Real life stuff, no theoretical mumbo-jumbo.

\- It snowed today.  Correction: it was a proper blizzard outside for the better part of 2 hours this morning.  It's April 19. This is not right.

\- Apparently this school year is the Year of Love.  I've now had 5 friends get engaged, with a bunch more friends/acquaintances also getting engaged/married. I'm nothing but happy for them, but I always feel a little twinge when it happens.  Less and less every time though, which is nice.

\- Nothing frustrates me more than getting down to crunch time in school, and having professors that are unwilling to communicate effectively with students, or provide them with the needed materials for their closing projects. One professor refuses to provide her Powerpoint slides before class, when she has promised this all year.  Another won't give us a template we need in order to have 3 rough drafts of our final done by Monday. And the third... well, it's quite the opposite. Info overload, plus a group project worthy of the time and attention of a senior thesis.  Ugh.

\- On top of that, I've got prep for Easter weekend for church. Rehearsal all afternoon on Sunday, after work tonight, Saturday afternoon, and then service Sunday. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to be serving, I just wish there were 28 hours in a day. And since I didn't get the things I needed to work on, I've blown about 6 hours that I could've been working already.

\- I hate school. Yet by the same token, I keep thinking I want to go back and do... other things.  Something's wrong with me.

Anyone else feeling extremely stressed out as of late?
