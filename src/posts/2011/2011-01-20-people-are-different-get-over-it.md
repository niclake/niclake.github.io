I can't believe I really have to blog about this again.

Today, [the Iowa House of Representatives announced](http://dmjuice.desmoinesregister.com/article/20110120/NEWS10/101200336/1001/NEWS) that they are introducing legislation in order to amend the Iowa Constitution in order to ban not only gay marriage, but civil unions and domestic partnerships as well.

What.. the...

Look, I get it.  I really do. There are people out there that hate the gays, just like there are people out there that hate the blacks, the women, the Jews, and so forth. And you know what? As much as I dislike the thought of people hating someone else for something like that... whatever.

But when you step into a position of leadership, you need to leave all your predispositions about people at the door.  All of them.  This holds true for managers, for teachers, for CEOs, for government officials, for preachers, and the like.

In addition, we should not be utilizing our religious beliefs (or lack thereof) as a tool for making government policy.  Read that sentence again.  A couple times, if you need to.

Look, I'll say it time and again.  I'm a Christian.  I will never, ever try to hide that.  I have certain morals and standards that other people would deem "weird", "dumb", or "lol wtf is wrong w u?", but that's ok.  I hope to someday meet a nice woman that shares my beliefs, get married, have a family, and raise my children under those same morals.  Hopefully, some of them will stick with them throughout their lives.

**But regardless of how I think, it gives me zero right to meddle in the affairs of others, when said affairs have zero impact on my life.**

I have my opinions on abortion... but I'm not a woman, I will never personally be pregnant, and so my opinions will always stay as such.  I have my opinions on gay marriage (probably different than you think they might be, considering the post I'm making)... but I'm not gay, so I will stay out of it.  I have no right to tell these people what they can and cannot do with their lives.  I will freely give my opinion, and that's that.

Another big argument is that marriage is a holy bond.  To some people, it is.  That's why 99% (made up figure) of marriages take place in a church, with a priest/preacher presiding over the service.  But it got a lot less holy when the government decided to start justifying your tax brackets based off of whether you were married or not.

Fine, you want my opinions?  Here they are.  I would much rather that gays have a certain "civil union" that gives them 100% of the rights and privileges of straight couples.  I think that being gay, at the core, is a sin.  None of it matters in the political realm, however.  I will never, EVER impose my religious beliefs upon someone unwarranted...  but that's what Iowa's lawmakers appear to be trying to do now.

What scares me even more is the possibility that the GOP may be utilizing this proposed bill as a bargaining chip in the House.  "Tell you what, you let these X number of bills slip through unopposed, and we'll magically change our mind on the 'gay' bill."  .... that makes me want to vomit.

Remember the civil rights movement for the Blacks (African Americans?  What's the proper term now?)?  Remember how much hate and anger and violence there was?  Or what about the Nazi discrimination of the Jews?  Remember how an entire world war kinda seeped out of that?

I'm not arguing gay rights, or black rights, or women's rights... I'm arguing HUMAN rights.  Every single human in this country (and on this planet, for that matter) deserves to be treated exactly the same as everyone else.  If my friend Kat wants to get married, she should have every right to do so.  The fact that she wants to marry my friend Ashley should be irrelevant.

The fact that some people are pig-headed and egotistical enough to think that gays getting married somehow impacts their own well-being makes me physically ill.  I honestly can't believe we're burning taxpayer dollars trying to take away someone's human rights.

(Side note: [removing a service man/woman via DADT and replacing them cost the gov't $193 million over 6 years](http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/01/20/dont.ask.dont.tell.costs/index.html).)
