This is me venting.  I get angry about dumb stuff like this.

Every time I send out an email to someone who I have little correspondence with, I always include my full signature.  It looks as follows:

Thanks, -- Nicholas J. "Nic" Lake Email: \[REDACTED\] Phone: \[REDACTED\]

And if we have a conversation going, or it's more of an informal email, the signature will simply say:

\-- Nic

Oh, and incoming emails?  They are from "Nic Lake".

So seriously, how flippin' hard is it to read, comprehend, and spell my name properly?

I have had 2 people today send me emails in which I initiated contact (with the full signature), and they are still unable to properly spell my name.  And both of these people?  Professors of mine.  School professors, the ones grading my papers and tests.

Here's what you misspelling my name tells me:

1) You're incompetent. 2) You don't give a damn. 3) Your time is too precious to even skim the emails, and you'll just respond with whatever you feel like. (see #2)

If I was more immature, I would respond back with gross butchering of their names, just to see if they'd get the point.  I mean, I realize "Nic" is not exactly the common way of spelling my name, but c'mon.

This Public Service Announcement has been brought to you by the letter K, which seems to be making its way into every email addressed to me today.
