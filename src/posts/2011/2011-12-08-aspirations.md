I aspire to be great.

In fairness, I'm fairly certain that there's no one in the world that doesn't think that. I mean, certainly, the average human probably doesn't walk around on a day to day basis thinking that exact phrase, but I'm fairly certain that there's not a single person on earth that aspires to be anything less than "great".

So why are we so set on just being OK in our lives?

I read a quote tonight about a guy that bought a lap steel guitar, and used it live in a professional setting without really knowing how to play it. He just learned as he went. He said, *"It was fun and scary. Which is what music should be."*

He grabbed the bull by the horns. Life by the balls. Whatever strange metaphor you wanna use. He was completely and totally vulnerable, not because he wanted to be, but because it challenged him to be great, to rise above the difficulties and succeed.

Mediocrity has dug me, has dug my friends, has dug America into a hole that's pretty darn deep. But we can climb out. I know I can, and I know you can too. We just have to do great things.

So with thatâ€¦ hello blog world. I'm back.
