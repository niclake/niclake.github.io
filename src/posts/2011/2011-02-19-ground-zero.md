Too often, we build up extravagant structures in our lives and allow them to define us and rule us.  You could be a business owner consumed by your work, a musician that thinks you're better than everyone you've ever met (guilty, on occasion), a volunteer that gets sucked into whatever they're spending their time on, a person that gets consumed with spending time with their newest boy/girlfriend... it can be any number of things.

I'm not saying that any of these things are bad, not in the slightest.  Business owners should love what they do, musicians and artists are fueled by their egos, helping out with some activity or group is a wonderful thing, and everyone always falls head over heels for a crush. But when you stretch yourself too thin, when you push yourself to the limits, you lose your foundation.  Just like any building, a person without a strong foundation is bound to collapse.  Trying to add any sort of extra fluff to your life is pointless if you don't have good roots to steady you.

Everyone has moments in their lives that are going to shake them straight to their core.  With a good foundation, things will get shaken down, but a person can stand strong.  Without a foundation, everything will shatter and crumble around people.  You can tell people to have a strong foundation, and live by example, but some people will need to learn from their mistakes before they'll be able to start solid.

How's your foundation?  Are you rock steady?  Or are you ready to crumble at the first sign of pressure?
