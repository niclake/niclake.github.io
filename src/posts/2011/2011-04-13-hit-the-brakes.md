![](images/speeding%20car%20fast%20flying%20driving%20driver.jpg)Human beings aren't built to go 100 miles a minute.  We just aren't.  And yet it seems that is how the 21st century American tries to live their life.

University students are frequently bombarded with projects, tests, and assignments about this time of year.  Parents are driving kids all over town to various events now that the weather is nice.  Douchebags on crotch rockets are screaming down the street, revving their bikes as loud as they can.  Yes, we see you, shirtless and wearing a ball cap.  Way to be safe.

I hit the brakes today.  Graphic Design just went down to the computer lab to work, and instead of partaking, I decided to come home, sit outside, and enjoy the lovely weather.  70 and sunny, light breeze... yep, I can dig it.  My new favorite Pandora station in my headphones (search for Aether, and enjoy), the grass between my toes... I am perfectly content right now.

Slow down.  Breathe.  Life isn't a sprint, it's a marathon.  Feel free to pull over and enjoy the scenery.  Rule #32 of Zombieland: enjoy the little things.  (Like Emma Stone.  Mmmmmm...)

P.S. you remember back in the day when you were, like, 3?  And in day care?  And had some smokin' hot chicks taking care of you all day?  What a life...
