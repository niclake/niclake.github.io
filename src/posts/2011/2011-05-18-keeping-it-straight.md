On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of meeting with <a href="http://patrickrhone.com" target="_blank">Patrick Rhone</a>. For those unfamiliar with Patrick, he is the curator of multiple blogs, with <a href="http://minimalmac.com/" target="_blank">his most popular being Minimal Mac</a>.

Patrick released his first book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Keeping-It-Straight-ebook/dp/B004YR6PXG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1305765852&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Keeping It Straight</a>" on May 3rd. I've been reading and enjoying the things that he writes for quite a while now, so it was a no brainer for me to buy this book. I've had a review of this book penned for a while, but I wanted to meet with Patrick and fill in a couple of gaps before I posted it.

This is not that review.

In my 4 hours with Patrick, this is what I discovered:

- Everything he does, everyone he interacts with, and every thought that he pours out into written or verbal form is something that he is incredibly passionate about. The organization of his computers and his thoughts, the company he keeps, his plans for 20 years from now, and even the location of his house; all of these have deeper meaning for Patrick that most people would never consider.

- Great curation isn't just a hobby for Patrick, it's a way of life. For lunch, he took me to a small Caribbean Creole restaurant. Their menu was limited, and the food was outstanding. He pointed out a wine shop and a men's clothing store, both of which contained  small inventories, knowledgable owners, and strove for excellence in what they did. And he talked about <a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/5584824313/icloud-conjecture-magic-and-a-fools-hope" target="_blank">a topic that he'd been pondering for a while</a> with me and another friend of his, using us as sounding boards, testing his ideas and thoughts.

- Patrick is also a huge history buff. Within a minute of walking into his backyard, I was getting an informative history lesson about his house and the surrounding areas. We also discussed technology, and how if history is any indication, we have no idea what the future will have in store for us.

- Life is about picking your battles. Patrick's house is, for lack of a better term, cluttered. His wife organizes by keeping piles of materials for various projects, and saves everything. His 3 year old daughter's presence dominates the downstairs of his residence, with toys working their way into every nook and cranny. And here's Mr. Rhone, a self-proclaimed Get Things Done and minimalist guy. He works with the things he can control; his iPad and MacBook Air, his desk, his mind. He keeps these areas clean and organized, even among the clutter of the house. This allows him to not only be productive, but to truly appreciate his area, his zone, and his place of peace.

- Companies don't benefit from giving other people benefits for being "valued customers". ***Everyone*** should be a valued customer, and be treated as such.

- Patrick is equal parts engaging, enlightening, fascinating, and hilarious. All of those are accompanied by an absolutely incredible bank of knowledge stored in his head.

All that being said, there's no reason for me to give you a review of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Keeping-It-Straight-ebook/dp/B004YR6PXG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1305765852&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Keeping It Simple</a>". The book is a gateway between the reader and Patrick's inner thoughts and feelings. If you read the book, you know quite a bit about the man. If you know the man, the things you read in the book come as no surprise.

I will, however, share my favorite quote from the book, out of the article "Time Is Precious":

> Therefore, treat [time] as what it is - the most precious thing in existence. Don't squander a single second. Perhaps, even more importantly, don't waste time regretting the time you do squander or lose. Instead, look to how you are going to use this very moment to do something… Anything. Enjoy a simple breath, or make a memorable mark. Don't worry about the next until the next thing comes along. This moment is far too important.
