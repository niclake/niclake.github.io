That Thing you've been wanting to do? ***Do it.***

Take that trip. Apply for that new job. Start writing that book. Learn that instrument. Play that video game. Ask that special someone on a date. Buy that thing you've been eying for 20 years. Try that new restaurant. Go to that show.

Life is short. Way too short. Opportunity will pass you by, and you'll regret not doing The Thing that you really wanted to.

Life is about experience. You can't experience The Thing if you don't do The Thing. Don't read someone's post about The Thing and think "man, I wish I had done that". Go do The Thing.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have Things to do.
