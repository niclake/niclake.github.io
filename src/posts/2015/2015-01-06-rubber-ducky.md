Being a programmer can be lonely, depending on your position. At my current job, I'm the only software developer on staff, so any and all changes run through me. It's a powerful position to be in, but also an isolated one. If I get stuck, there's no one to turn to.

There's a concept out there called **rubber ducky debugging**, in which programmers explain what each line of code does to a rubber duck (or other inanimate object). When we read, it's easy to gloss over things; if we're forced to speak aloud to someone/something, often times the issue with what you're working on becomes much clearer.

I used to use colleagues as rubber ducks. At old jobs, I'd walk over to someone's cube to ask a question, get a sentence or two into my description of the issue, and it would suddenly just click. After doing this for the hundredth time, another developer pointed to my Red Sox bobblehead and said "why don't you just talk to him?"

So I did. And I continue to do so today. Dr. Mango (a monkey), Wally (the Red Sox mascot), and Cubebot (a folding wooden toy) help me every day at my current job. (Yeah, I know. They're not ducks.)

There are many times we gloss over issues that are staring us right in the face because we believe so stubbornly that we are right about everything. My code is perfect, my morals are flawless, my political viewpoint is the best, etc. Sometimes, all it takes is saying these things out loud to make the light bulb switch on and illuminate the dark corners of our mind.

(Of note: if any programming instructors happen to be reading this, go buy a bunch of rubber ducks & give them to your students on the first day of classes. Have them carry that duck & use it throughout college. I wish someone had done that for me.)
