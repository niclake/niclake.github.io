I found a [post on Reddit][reddit] a couple of weeks ago about a great playlist to listen to while programming or coding. So far, I can say that it's been doing a great job - lots of ambient, chill, yet still energetic music that's helped me be less distracted throughout the day. The original URL from the Reddit post is dead, but I've managed to rescue & recreate the playlists in both [Apple Music][apple] and [Spotify][spotify] using a slick service called [TuneMyMusic][tune].

Additionally, I also discovered [MusicForProgramming.net][mfpweb], a very cool looking site that has a bunch of shorter playlists of music for this same purpose. I haven't dug into this one much, but I will, and thought y'all might be interested in this as well.
