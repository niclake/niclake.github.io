![Now That's What I Call Content][headerImg]

Taking a cue from a few other people, like my good friend [Patrick Rhone](https://www.patrickrhone.net/now/), I've gone ahead and implemented [a new Now page](/now/).

I have my own personal lists of things that I try to stay on top of in regards to what my current priorities are, but exposing them to the world allows others to keep me accountable ("hey, how's Project X going for you?"), or invites people to read/play the same things I do, or just shares info with the world about what my life is all about. I'd encourage you to share your Now pages with me - I'm always curious what types of things people are working on.
