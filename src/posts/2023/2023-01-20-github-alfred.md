Yesterday, [I posted about how I consolidated some of my Mac helper apps](/mac-helper-apps). I was talking to members of the [Relay.FM member's Discord](https://www.relay.fm/membership) when going through this exercise, and I happened to mention an Alfred workflow that I had helped create for work. Enough people seemed interested in it that I went through the whole process of getting it set up for other people to download.

Introducing: the [GitHub Repository Helper workflow](https://github.com/niclake/alfred-github-repo-helper) for [Alfred.app](http://alfredapp.com)

<!-- more -->

This workflow is pretty straight-forward. You first scan all of your repos tied to your GitHub account, and then you can pull them up using Alfred with the command `gh {repo_name}`. At that point, you can press enter to go straight to the repo in your browser, or hold various keys to copy the repo's URL, or jump straight to the repo's pull requests, issues, or projects page.

You can download the latest version of the workflow [on GitHub](https://github.com/niclake/alfred-github-repo-helper/releases/latest/download/github-repo-helper.alfredworkflow), or [view the latest release](https://github.com/niclake/alfred-github-repo-helper/releases/latest).
