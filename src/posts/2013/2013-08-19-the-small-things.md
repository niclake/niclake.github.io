Calling that friend you haven't chatted with in a while, just to check in.

Texting someone, instead of waiting/expecting them to text you.

Visiting your parents unexpectedly.

Cleaning/picking up for your significant other.

Helping out someone on a big project they have due.

Driving to jump someone's car in the dead of winter.

Everyone always puts the big things on their listâ€¦ "Remember our anniversary." "Get that birthday present." "Don't forget your lunch meeting." etc. But it's the little gestures that you make for someone that will mean the most. Always. Every time.

My best friends are my best friends because of the little things that they did for me. It's not necessarily how much we have in common or the big extravagant things we did, but rather the times we could vent to one another, go grab food, or other little things that solidified our friendship.

Take care of the small things. Everything else will fall into place.
