You have to start somewhere. Sometime.

Only you know what it is you want.

Find your end goal. Work your way back step-by-step. What needs to be done in order to get from where you are to where you want to be?

Money? Get a job. Knowledge? Find a resource. Motivation? Tell a friend that will challenge you and keep you honest.

Honest. That's the best thing. Be honest. With your friends, with yourself, with your time. "I can do it tomorrow..." but you won't. And you know it.

The only person holding you back from what you want is you.

Ladies and gentlemen... start your engines.
