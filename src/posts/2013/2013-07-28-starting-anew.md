Yet again, another claim of "oh I'll start blogging again!" Yet another opportunity to see if I'll actually follow through…

Figured I'd recap what has taken place since <a href="http://blog.niclake.com/2013/04/a-fresh-start/" target="_blank">the last time that I actually blogged, nearly 4 months ago</a>. Here goes…

The new job (.NET programmer for a company that provides insurance and other services to credit unions and credit union customers) is going ok. I just went through 2.5 weeks of being the primary support for a product line, and only had 1 issue that was easily fixed. Not sure how satisfied I am, but the job is improving every day and the pay is great, so I can't really complain.

Working out hasn't gone well. I pulled my hamstring pretty bad during the 2nd week of my workout program (it's freakin' INTENSE), and then went out of town for a couple weeks for work, so that was pretty much the end of it. Tried to start it back up again, and just can't get into it. By the time work is over I have minimal desire to hit the gym or run or whatever. Need to fix that.

Clearly I'm not blogging more. Sorry. :(

More reading… um… I'm about 2/3 of the way through the 2nd Game of Thrones. Getting back into reading more, though. I need to finish this book and polish off 20 more books in 5 months (1 book/week) in order to meet my yearly goal. Definitely doable.

Music making is going, albeit slowly. Once I moved, I made some huge overhauls to my gear, and all the pieces aren't here yet. I've got plenty of ideas, though… 2 of the 5 songs are about 50% done (structure complete, but parts not recorded), and a 3rd is pretty well fleshed out. 5 or 6 songs will be on this one.

I figured it was high time to write again. In about a month, I'll be visiting Chicago in order to meet <a href="http://itismejoey.com" target="_blank">Joey</a>, <a href="http://dailykitty.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Kitty</a>, <a href="http://www.rachelskirts.com" target="_blank">Rachel</a>, and hopefully a couple more blogger friends I've made over the years. Everyone else I know is taking vacations, so I figured a weekend away would be a good idea.

I've also updated my <a href="http://blog.niclake.com/2013-goals/" target="_blank">2013 goals</a>… <a href="http://themusicplaysyou.com/" target="_blank">finished the EP</a>, doing ok on the recipes, and miserably failing on the rest of them. Whoops.
