I think people (myself included sometimes) view "adulthood" wrong.

Being an adult doesn't mean you can't have fun. It doesn't mean that you stay in every night, go to bed at 9pm, work the typical office job, and nothing else. It CAN, and for a lot of people, it DOES, but it doesn't have to.

Being an adult means that you've learned how to say "no" to things. Not to be a fuddy duddy or whatever, but instead to allow you to say "yes" to other things. Things that matter more. Or cost less money (which, as we age, we discover matters more).

I say "no" to staying up until 2am so I can say "yes" to not being a zombie at my day job. Because I like paychecks. And the cute girl in the office shows up at 8am sharp, so I like to get to work around then anyway.

I say "no" to going out to eat all the time so I can say "yes" to spending money on musical gear. Except for burritos... if you ask me to go get a burrito for you, I'll probably yell at you to hurry up.

I say "no" to getting a kitten so I can say "yes" to all sorts of things. Going out. Buying nice things. Not ticking off my landlord. I mean, I love kittens, but that's just not something I need to get right now.

Say "no" now so you can say "yes" later. Just don't be afraid of actually saying "yes" when the time comes.
