A flash of light electrifies the nighttime sky. It flickers, violent and unpredictable.

A roar of thunder follows, washing over you, penetrating your soul and shaking you to the core.

Another flash, and another. Some close by, others far away. The sky is illuminated, the landscape drawn in an artistic and macabre scene.

The thunder varies. A crack so loud you jump. A rumble here and there. A soft growl that's drawn on for so long, it terrifies you more than the loud ones.

And then the drops begins to fall. Just a few at first, then more, until the rhythmic "plops" become a constant. Soothing and cool, it washes over everything with a cleansing vigor.

You stand in the rain, eyes closed. You can still see the lightning through closed lids, and feel the thunder as it shakes you, but you no longer care.

Nature washes the fear away.

The storm rages on, but the rain cleanses us of our worry.

Calm.

Serene.

Peace.
