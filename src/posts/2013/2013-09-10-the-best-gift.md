I know the best gift that you can give to anyone.

It's not something physical. You can't touch this gift. No one else will ever see it, so you can't give it and expect the recipient to show it off.

No, the best gift you can give to someone, anyone, is the gift of listening. Not just hearing, but listening. Understanding. Comprehending. Showing them that you pay attention and care.

Sometimes this can manifest as a physical gift. "I really like this watch" is a subtle hint. "Man, I could use a break" is an excuse to take your friends to a movie or out for a drink. "____ is my favorite color!" .... Yeah, you get the idea.

But more often than not, showing the person that you genuinely care what they say is a gift beyond measure.

So shhh. Just for a minute.

And listen.
