We have 5 months until the end of the calendar year. How the heck did this happen?

To say that this year has gone by in a blur would be a huge understatement. With my mom getting cancer/passing away, I'm not sure where the first quarter of this year went. Then apparently I've been at my new job for 4 months now. No clue where that time went either. Actually, it's hard to grasp where all my time has gone since I graduated last May. Yeesh.

Anyway, I have a HUGE list of things that I still want to accomplish between now and the end of the year. In no particular order, other than what comes to mind first...

- Successfully complete VEDA
- Accomplish my goal of reading 25 books this year. If I keep trying to read all the Game of Thrones books, it may not happen... but they're SO GOOD!
- Record my 2nd EP. Song ideas are there. New gear will be in place Monday. I have no excuse.
- Don't screw up my very custom fantasy football league I'm the commissioner of. Once the draft is over, I think I'll be ok. (D&D for sports nerds)
- Get back in the f***** gym. Get on the bike or the treadmill or grab some weights. Someone yell at me.

There's some other minor things, but those 5 top it. I just feel like I don't have enough hours in the day. Womp womp... first world problems, right?
