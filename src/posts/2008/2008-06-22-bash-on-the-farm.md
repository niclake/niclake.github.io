I'm absolutely exhausted.

That about sums up how my weekend went.  I went with Crossed to go play at Bash on the Farm up in Garner, IA.  Small little hole-in-the-wall town, but still had about 2,000 people show up for both days.  Got to see some pretty sweet bands (Naomi, Sara Groves, Everyday Sunday, The Wedding, Spoken, and lots more) and we had a pretty good crowd for our show too.

Definitely forgot to put on sunscreen for Saturday... so now I look like Rudolph again.  Oh well.

I also finally got a break that I've been looking for for the past couple of years... I'll let you know if I manage to get it or not. :-)

Short update today because I'm sleepy.
