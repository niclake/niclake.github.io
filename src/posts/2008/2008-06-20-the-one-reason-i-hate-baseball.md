I love baseball.  I really do.  It's not as exciting as football, or as energetic as baseball, or as fascinating to watch as soccer, but there's something about it that I always go back to.  Long games?  Real rivalries?  162 games a season?  I don't really know what it is... but you give me a choice of any sports game on TV vs. a Red Sox game, and I'll go to my beloved Boston every time.

But let me explain, in some detail, the reason why I oh-so-hate this game sometimes...

Beginning of the season: Willie Randolph is the manager of the New York Mets, a team with some fabulous pitching, pretty good hitting, and good defense.  These guys are supposed to make the postseason (according to speculations) and vie for a title.

Progress forward a bit: Players are getting hurt (it happens), and the team just isn't performing up to snuff.  NY fans are already calling for Willie to be fired, but he sticks in there, tries to do the best job he possibly can.

Fast forward to Sunday: The GM of the Mets has been fired.  Usually, this is a bad sign for managers, but Willie is still there.  The owner tells him that his job is still safe, despite a pitiful record.  Go get on the plane with your team and go out to CA for a 3-game series.

Monday: The owner wakes up, gets on his own plane, flies out to CA to watch the game.  The Mets win.  There was much rejoicing. (Yay...) Then the owner approaches Willie and pulls a Trump on him... "You're fired."

What changed between Sunday and Monday?  He won the game for you.  Here's a pat on the back and a stack of settlement papers... have a nice day.

Pro athletes are million-dollar crybabies (or can be... there are a few exceptions).  I think owners are worse.  A lot of owners seem to think they have the power of God (\*cough George Stinebrenner cough\*), and if their team isn't winning "a game", they're flipping out.  Now, I realize that the MLB, NBA, NFL, and whatnot is a business for the purpose of entertainment, but some of these idiotic moves really just make me scratch my head in bewilderment.

Anyway, I expect to see Willie back in the majors sometime this year... or if not, he'll be around next year for sure.
