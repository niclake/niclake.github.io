I have determined that I'm going to start a little mini-series within my blog here... weekly?  Idk.  We'll find out.

Simple Pleasure #1

The thing that has always relaxed/thrilled/excited/mellowed me all at once, ever since the age of 16, was this: driving.  Not just any driving... but driving the car, at night, down familiar but empty roads, (safely of course) as fast as you feel like driving.

Now, I don't condone speeding.  There are laws there for your safety, and if you get caught, tough luck.  But at the same time, nothing says "I'm in control, I have power, this is my life" more than sitting behind the wheel of your (or your parents) car, cranking up some good tunes, and flying down a roadway.  At first, there's this initial rush of adrenaline when you max your speed out (my personal record was 108, the summer before college.  Yes, Mom, your car goes that fast), but then... well, it's almost like zoning out, but not really... but you become totally relaxed.  As my dad always says, "you're driving a 2 ton missile"... and it's true... but you are driving the car, not the other way around.

And with no one around, no one watching, no one telling you what to do... idk, it's just nice.

I didn't speed tonight, though.  I actually set the cruise and did the speed limit all the way home from work.  It's just something that I thought of.

Give me your thoughts/ideas.  I'll try them out, see if they make the list.
