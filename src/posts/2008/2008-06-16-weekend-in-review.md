After my initial slew of posts, I've kinda lost inspiration for some of those epic posts... so instead, I'll just kinda review my weekend.

Saturday: Worked.  I woke up at 7 and felt fine, but the minute I stepped into work I was exhausted.  I was dozing in and out the entire day... it was pretty bad.  Nothing else much going on.  Took my dad to the airport so he can go to Phoenix for work.  Apparently it's 108 degrees there.

Sunday: Worked out some, determined that I need to actually organize my workouts somewhat (especially when I'm trying to improve my basketball game), so I set up some ground rules for that.  Indulged in my final day of "good eats"... I guess if you could call it that... before I begin my strict workout period.  We'll see how long that lasts... there's just not much else to eat around my house.  Otherwise, my dog demanded my attention since Dad was gone, so I sat downstairs, watching Tiger's amazing, gritty performance and the refs hand the LA Kobe's a win so they can extend the season and make more money.

Tiger Woods = Baller.  No matter what sport I'm playing, I'm picking him first.  He gets a round and a half into the weekend, then realizes "Oh wait, this is a competition" and starts to actually play.  Makes a few mistakes today, grits out obvious knee pain after his surgery, and just demolishes that final putt to force a playoff tomorrow morning.  Makes me kinda sad that I'll be working out... I'm probably gonna miss most of it unless I'm in the weight room.

Nothing really puts the screws to the competition and says "Yes, I am, in fact, the best" like playing a golf tournament fresh off of knee surgery... and forcing a playoff.  If he'd won outright, that would just be Tiger being Tiger.  But coming back, bad tee shot, short 2nd shot, and leaving himself a long birdie putt on the 18th, then getting a little rim action before sinking it just defies all logic.

What's really sad is a) I have no idea how Lefty (aka Phil) did, and b) I have no clue who Tiger is playing tomorrow... all I know about him is if he wins, he will be both the lowest ranked and the oldest golfer to ever win the U.S. Open.

Place your bets... I guess..

I have almost achieved the "most meaningless" goal on my list... over the course of the golf tournament and the basketball game, I leveled my character in WoW from 67.5 to 69.  Most don't care.  I'm excited.

The Dark Knight comes out on a weekend I'm going to be on tour.  This makes me kind of sad.  Is there going to be a midnight release of this?  If so... who wants to go?

Let's see... what does the week have in store?  Work, band practice, work, work, weekend tour w/ the band.  Going to try and get at least 2 days of exercise in there... maybe 3.  We'll see how things go.  I need to buy a basketball and a jump rope... I hate mooching off the WRC (plus, their stuff gets abused).  The road trip will be interesting too... we're going to Garner, IA for Bash On The Farm.  Callie Weiss will be there too... really really good singer (and she's very very attractive too... haha).  It should be a good time.

That's probably enough for now... I'm amazed how long winded these can get sometimes.
