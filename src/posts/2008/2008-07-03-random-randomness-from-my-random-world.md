Have you ever had one of those days where your body is absolutely exhausted, but your brain is just jumpy and ready to go?

Have you ever had that, only prolonged over the better part of a week?

I'm not sure if it's fun, or annoying.  I've been this way since Friday night.  We (Crossed) had a mini tour this weekend in South Dakota.  Loading in and tearing down really wears on you pretty quickly.

Also, note to self... however good homemade food tastes, always prepare your stomach for the worst... and when in doubt, don't follow up biscuits and gravy with Taco Bell.

Anyway, it has been far too long since I've updated... which also directly correlates to how long it's been since I've worked... this, unfortunately, is not good.

In other news... my bass and bass amp are still for sale.  Please, if you know anyone who wants to buy one, send them my way.  The sale of these is probably going to make or break me living back in the dorms in August.  Ugh.

Oh, and my driver's door may be fixed by this weekend.  JOY!!!!

That's really all I've got.  Maybe tomorrow at work I'll come up with something.
