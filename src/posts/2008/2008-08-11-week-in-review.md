Just kinda reviewing my week... I have no idea who even reads this.

Started working at John Deere.  I love it.  Basically, my job consists of building, installing software on, and deploying computers to employees at the various John Deere sites in Waterloo.  There's enough mix of work and downtime that this job is entertaining, and I enjoy the people I work with, so that's an added bonus.

I've decided to take Logan's suggestion and start running.  He found something online (http://www.c25k.com) about a 9-week program to get off the couch and running a 5k.  I don't know how my hip is going to hold up, but I figured I'd give it a shot.

I'm also starting a solo-ish project.  Eventually I'll record stuff in good quality and with drums, but for now everything will be craptacular stuff done in my bedroom at my parent's house... I'll load the stuff to http://www.myspace.com/theflyingpancreasexperiment for the time being.  Yes, that's right... The Flying Pancreas Experiment.

On a side note... I hate shady people.  Speak your mind, mean what you say, and if you don't like something, then speak up.  The person this is about won't be reading this (or at least, I don't think they will), but I just needed to vent a bit... stupid people really annoy me.

And that's all.
