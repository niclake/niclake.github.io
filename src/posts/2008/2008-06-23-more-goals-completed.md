I'm feeling somewhat proud of myself.

Without the use of a guitar or piano, I have managed to completely write 2 songs today.  I'm really really happy about this... after going back and looking through some of the old stuff, seeing what's still good, what's been modified, and what is just plain bad, I think I have enough that I might contemplate recording some of these.  Some songs are only acoustic, but the two today are full band songs... woohoo.

I'm curious as to how well they'll actually sound once they come off the paper and onto the instruments...

In other news, my nose is sunburnt, and it itches.
