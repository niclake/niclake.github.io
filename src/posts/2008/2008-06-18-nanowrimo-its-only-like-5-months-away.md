The most "novel" ideas come to you in the restroom... yet no one ever admits to their genius they come across while depositing offerings in the porcelain receptacles. Weird.  
  
Anyway... I've determined (in June) that I'm going to [participate in NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org), or the National Novel Writing Month (in November) again. I've participated twice (in '05 and '06), but fizzled out after about 2 weeks each time. Life just catches up to me, and I tell myself that I don't have time.  
  
For those that have never heard of this before, NaNoWriMo is a non-profit organization out of Oakland, CA that tries to get participants to write a novel in a month (by novel, I meant 50,000 words, or roughly 175 pages). They don't expect finished products, and a lot of pain/hilarity goes into all of the works that are written. It's a fun time to be had for anyone who has ever enjoyed writing, and wondering what writing on a deadline might be like.  
  
I enjoyed my time doing this immensely, and for whatever reason began thinking about this year's writing period today. I guess the only thing now is to figure out what I want to write about. In the past, I attempted to write blind... that failed. I attempted to write with a full outline... that also failed.  
  
I think what I want to try this year is to have a basic premise, maybe very general character and/or plot outlines, and roll with that.  
  
Here's the problem... my current plot ideas are really limited, and I don't know if I'll be able to work something out or not. It's good to just fly with a story, but I'd like it to resemble something somewhat.  
  
Here's what I've got:  

1) Some sort of techno-space thriller-ish something. (That's about as vague as I can be without my head exploding.)  
  
2) Some sort of non-techno fantasy-world thriller-ish something. (......)  
  
3) (modeled after a combo of I Am Legend and the new Die Hard) Modern day, when terrorists attack the communications systems. No phones, internet, TV, radio, anything like that. (This is by far the most promising one I've thought of yet, but I'm not sure where it would go.)  
  
Do you have any ideas? I've got months, and I might try and get some general plot outlines written between now and then... maybe even post them here, I don't know. But if you've got a crazy/good/lame idea for a story, let me know. I'd think about them all... at least for a bit.  
  
Along those lines... funny quote.
