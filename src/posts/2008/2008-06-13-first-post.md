Well, since Logan, Lauren, and Dustin are all doing it, I thought I'd jump in.

No, really. I've meant to start one of these up for a long long time, and being stuck at work with no phone calls until 10pm has given me every opportunity to do so.

So, just to explain a bit...

I'm not exactly sure what this blog is going to become. It may have reviews, it may have rants, it may have just about anything on the face of this earth. Granted, it won't \*all\* be about music... I have many other interests in this world (sports, video games, computers, art, food, etc.) and I'm sure a lot of those will be covered as well.

Whether you comment or not, I truly don't care. I'm just happy that you're taking the time to read whatever ramblings are currently in my head.
