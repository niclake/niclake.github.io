Fourth post in a few hours? Sue me.

Anyway... for those of you that aren't really sports fans out there, I'll spell this out as simply as I can for you.

1) MVP = Most Valuable Player. Back in an article that I read about a week before the MVP was announced, it was something along the lines of the most memorable, most exciting, and best player award, all rolled into one, but it also took into account what the player does for their team.

2) This award is given after the \*regular season\* is over. The finals have just started at this point, and there are 16 teams still left playing. You rarely see a member of a non-playoff team win this award, but I digress.

3) Most voters ignore the "team" stat, unless they give the award to Steve Nash, and that's only because his passing is so ridiculous that you are required to tape every Suns highlight on ESPN so you can watch it about 10 times to figure out exactly what he did.

This year, Kobe Bryant won the MVP award. Let's break this down a bit.

Most Memorable - Well, a year ago, Kobe was whining about how he wanted to be traded, calling into national radio stations to complain about how bad his team was, how pathetic his team's owner was, and how much he really missed Shaq on his team (ok, maybe not the last part). He railed on his teammates about how bad they were all season. He whined. He moaned. For a rich guy playing a game day in and day out, he cried more than Martha Steward did when she got sentenced to "prison" (rumor has it that they left the walls painted in whatever lovely colors she decorated them as). He hurt his pinky, and (gasp) there were thoughts that he couldn't play the rest of the season.

Then things changed.

While they officially call it a trade, I'd deem it either a gift from Memphis, or a sucker punch from the LA... somehow, they end up trading Kwame Brown (a decent player) and some nobodies for Pau Gasol, who, while not being nearly the dominant force that Shaq in his prime, Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard, or Vlade Divac (joking again) ever were, he was a vast improvement. Any time you can get a 7' guy on your team to loft the ball to, you're in good hands. Kobe passed up surgery. He... smiled? Yeah, that's a smile. Suddenly, the LA Kobes are now the LA Kobes-and-Friends. Role players were stepping up, and doing their jobs quite well, which made Kobe happy.

But see, I couldn't explain that all without mentioning Pau, or his teammates, or anyone else... seem fair?

Most Exciting - Seeing Kobe fly down the floor and dunk it, or pull of his crazy "get behind the 3-point line, and let me do my thing" wave and drive never ceases to amaze me. For pure basket scoring, I'd say he wins this.

Best Player - How do you define this? Most points? Ok, Kobe had that. Assists? Nope. Steals? Nope. Rebounds? Nope. Any other major category? Yep... technical fouls.

Best Teammate - Don't make me laugh.

So the only clear-cut winner here is most exciting. He lags in every other category.

On the other hand, you have Chris Paul... the little guy for the team and the city with the biggest heart. Chris Paul, who in his 3rd season was doing things to opposing teams that I can't believe still. Chris Paul, who led the league in assists and steals, rebounded decently for a guy not much taller than I am, and \*made his team better\*.

The way I personally would define MVP is this - Who, if you took them away from their team for the whole season, would fall flat on their faces?

LA Kobes (eventually I'll stop with that name, but Stephen A. Smith and Skip Bayless make me laugh every time they say that) - If they got rid of Kobe, they would've sucker punched some other team for a decent shooting guard. Fisher, Gasol, Walton, Odom and Sasha (I can't spell his last name) are all very very good players in their own right. With Kobe, they get better. Would they be a playoff team without Kobe? Probably not. Would they hold their own? Definitely.

N.O. Hornets - The Hornets without Chris Paul would be roughly the equivalent of a blind man trying to slalom ski. Possible? Sure. Probable? Buy me a lottery ticket. Chris Paul \*made\* that team. He will continue to make that team for years to come. He is, without a doubt, the new face of the NBA beside Lebron James. He is the guy that I want to see for years and years to come.

Think about this, when it comes to memorable moments. What do you like to see more? (And be honest with yourself.) A guy clearing everyone out, then driving in for a powerful dunk in someone's face? Or do you like to see a fast break with unbelievable ball handling and an insane pass that leaves the defender picking his dentures up off the free throw line?

And now, here they are in the Playoffs. Granted, the Kobes are in the Finals while NO was bounced early. But again, remember how I said that LA was still decent without Kobe. NO doesn't have a prayer without Chris Paul, and they know it. They have great players, but they're not a cohesive team without a quality point guard.

I have absolutely no problem with the NBA having a Regular-Season- and Finals-MVP. That's perfectly fine. I can't wait to see Paul Pierce host that trophy after the Celtics win the Finals this year... for the NBA Finals, he definitely deserves it. A memorable Game 1, and a gritty Game 4 performance locked that up real quick. But seriously, for Reg. Season MVP, the NBA needs to clearly define a set of rules on what makes people eligible for this award. When it came to making teammates better, I even thought that Kevin Garnett was a better candidate than Kobe is, or will ever be.

And after all that... I can't wait for Boston to hand it to LA \*in\* LA... it will be sweet.
