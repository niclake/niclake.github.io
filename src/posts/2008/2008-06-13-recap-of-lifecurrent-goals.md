So, there's some of you out there that may be wondering a thing or two about what's going on in my life. Maybe. Who knows. Anyway, here's some things...  
  
1) I'm not engaged. Ask me in person, don't go by rumors.  
  
2) I re-joined Crossed. I took time off from the band for many reasons, but when I got back for the summer, I picked up a guitar and realized how much I truly missed playing it, both by myself and with the band... so I went back to see if they were still in need, and now I'm back... just in time for 2 weekend tours, a festival, and Cornerstone. Woo woo. :-)  
  
3) I'm short on money. This is probably no surprise to anyone who actually knows me, but now it's been compounded... Hawkeye screwed me over pretty big in regards to financial aid, so I'm in the process of coming up with $3,200 to pay UNI for my room and board by the time school starts this fall. Crossing my fingers, I am... dunno if I'm gonna make it or not.  
  
Other than that, there's not been too much to my summer. I indulge into World of Warcraft (WoW) pretty frequently, but lately I've been working out more in my free time, so that's cut down a bit. Otherwise, I work 40ish hours a week at CFU... though with the flooding, that's made things interesting.  
  
Oh, and for those of you that thought I was bitten by a Microsoft curse when it came to how many Xbox 360's I'd been going through... it's not over. The power supply to my Wii crapped out on me somehow.  
  
But anywho... how about goals? Here are my goals for the summer.  
  
1) Make $2,200 (at least). A loan will cover the remaining $1,000, which will then all go to UNI so I can live there next year. Currently - $400 (though this is after a lot of bills that had to be paid)  
  
2) Drop down to 159 lbs. This is (apparently) the highest "healthy" weight for someone of my height (in relation to my BMI). Currently - 169 lbs.  
  
3) Write a bunch of new songs, whether for Crossed or myself. "A bunch" is kind of vague, but this way I can't get mad if I have writer's block or run out of time due to work/life/etc. Currently - 1 completely done, 1 in the works  
  
4) Hit level 70 with my main character in WoW. Some of you think it's a stupid goal, and that's fine. WoW is something I do for fun. I'm not addicted, and I've proven that when I've quit twice before. I enjoy the time I spend on there, either by myself or with the friends that I play with. While this isn't a main priority, it forces me to focus, as my ADD sometimes prevents me from accomplishing this goal. Currently - 67.
  
5) Go through an entire year without getting into severe medical issues. Between my arm, depression, my concussion, and my ankle, I've had 3 bad years, but not having health insurance right now makes me really focused in on this goal. Currently - 7 months.  
  
6) Listen to every song in my collection at least once. By "listen", I really mean that. I usually go to sleep with music playing, but I've been working on going through my entire collection, album by album, and getting 1 solid listen to every song in. A tedious task, considering I have over 29 days worth of music. Currently - Unknown... I'm in the F's somewhere (artist-wise).  
  
6.5) Along those lines... either from albums that I really enjoy, that I really despise, or new stuff that's just come out, I hope to put some reviews up on what I think of music. Hopefully I'll do a Pink Floyd album here in a bit, as well as the new Damiera and Coldplay CD's that are coming out later this month.  
  
And that's about it, for now... I'm sure I'll come up with something more later. I don't know how often/regularly I'll update this. I'm going to shoot for once a day, but I'm going to attempt to not include any lame/short/pointless posts in here.
