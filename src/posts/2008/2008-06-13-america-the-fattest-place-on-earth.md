So recently, I've been trying to get back into the kind of shape that I used to be. I've never been necessarily ripped or fit, but I used to have enough stamina when I was younger to play basketball for 3 or more hours at a time. Once my leg and arm started bothering me, I kinda dropped out of doing that as much.  
  
Lately, though, I've been hitting up the WRC pretty frequently, trying to accomplish one of my goals of getting back to an optimal BMI/weight. Plus, it's just plain fun to play basketball again.  
  
Anyway, on to the point... so I get home today after playing basketball for about 2-3 hours, and obviously I'm a little hungry, so I make myself some lunch and sit down to eat it. It's only after I'm about halfway through my meal that I realize exactly what I'm eating... tacos. Grease, fat, sodium, but damned if it doesn't taste oh so delicious.  
  
And that's when I realized... all this time, companies in America are more interested in marketing McDonald's, weight loss products, and plastic surgery locations than they are working to make food healthier, better tasting, and most importantly, affordable and easy to prepare.  
  
Think about it. When's the last time you went to get fast food, or grabbed something out of the cupboard, and what you ate was actually good for you? Like right now, here in the office, they have some amazing chocolate chip cookies. (And yes, I'm being a slight hypocrite, because I'm eating one right now...) Why can't they work on making a healthy snack, or making something quick and easy that children can make for themselves that's good for them?  
  
Answer: capitalism in America.  
  
Think about it. A kid eats Easy Mac. Sick. Eats it (or some equivilant) 5 times a week, 52 weeks a year. That's (roughly) 250 fattening meals per year.  
  
Now, in grade school, they combat this with a wonderful thing called recess. Ahh, recess... why can't you exist in college? But you get to high school, people are more concerned with the now... hanging out with friends, studying for a difficult test, working their part time job so they can get their first car, etc. al. Some people are in sports, or working hard to be Mr/Mrs Popular, so they obviously want to look good.  
  
But the food... it tastes so good...  
  
Then my high school (I don't know about yours) starts offering Pizza Hut pizza every Monday, or having a fully-stocked snack room available every day. The school lunches were usually catered to being somewhat healthy, but they tasted like absolute junk, so no one wanted to eat them (usually).  
  
And now I just look at life around my house, or at work, or whatever. The absolute easiest things for me to eat that come to mind are the following - sandwich, Pop Tart, Ramen noodles, leftover whatever, frozen pizzas, granola bars, cookies. Sandwiches at least give me a rounded meal, and leftovers (depending on what we had) can be decent... granola bars are about the only healthy thing on that list. Everything else either costs a buttload, or requires you to put quite a bit of thought and prep into eating it. Not exactly ideal for a college student.  
  
Then, on top of that, I'd be willing to be that somewhere in the mix, health product companies and medical people have approached food companies and asked them not to make their food as healthy as possible. Why? They'd be out of business. It's the same as cars and gas, or the age old hot dogs/hot dog buns... these people and products exist solely because America is full of overweight, non-caring individuals who don't wait until it's too late to do anything about their problems.  
  
And I'm one of those people. A lot of my arthritis/tendonitis is due to the fact that I've carried a little extra baggage around most of my life. It's not the only reason, but it's still a primary one.  
  
I used to think it was kinda funny when I would tease my dad about his gut. When my parents turn it around with the "like father, like son" line... well, that's when I know that enough is enough.  
  
So... is exercise enough to counteract the poor eating habits of Americans... or at least, \*this\* American? Does a slight modification of one's diet (i.e. less sweets, smaller portions, yadda yadda) really make a difference?  
  
We'll find out...
