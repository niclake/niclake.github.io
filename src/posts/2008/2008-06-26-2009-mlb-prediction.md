Yes, that's right... 2009. Â That's \*next\* year.

  

This actually takes part in this year as well.

  

1) The NY Yankees will finish no better than 3rd... 4th if Toronto steps their game back up.

2) Shortly after the WS gets over with (c'mon, Red Sox/Cubs matchup), Hank Stinebrenner will be ousted and George will come and take his rightful place back.

3) Serious rebuilding will happen, Jaba will get more practice as a starter, and the Yanks will be good.

4) Fast forward a bit... Yanks win the 2009 World Series.

  

You heard it here first.
