Just some random memories/thoughts about the floods we had here in Iowa.

A city the size of Cedar Falls escaped serious damage to their businesses and downtown area because 1) We put a disaster team in place about 7 years ago, and 2) because we have tons of people that volunteered their time to go and place sandbags on top of the new levee we built.  Cedar Rapids and Iowa City... well, I'm not sure what the reason is, but last time I checked, they had about 100 blocks that were under water.  Even Waterloo, who is just right down the road, still had a ton of flooding compared to what happened in CF.

That just makes me proud to be from this city.

But just to throw a little humor into the situation... here's my favorite quote from the whole fiasco.

News broadcaster - "...and so we are urging you to volunteer to go to Downtown Cedar Falls and help place sandbags on the levee.  We're worried that the river might crest above that wall and flood most of downtown."

Some random guy - "Oh no!  Not Cup of Joe!" \*dashes to his car to drive to the volunteer point\*

I got a good laugh out of that.
