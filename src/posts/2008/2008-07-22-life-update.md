So, for those that haven't heard... I got a new job.  I'll be working for TechTeam Global, doing IT stuff at John Deere.  It should be a good time.

Full time, however, means no school for me.  This is both an extremely happy and kinda sad moment for me.  I've always hated school and forced learning... I enjoy learning much more when I choose to, not when I'm forced to.  Plus, I couldn't really come to a determination on what I wanted to do... Music?  Computer Science? Religion? Business? Communications? Graphic Design?  Blah.

On the downside, I really am going to miss people/dorm life/so forth.  If you're in the dorms, I'm sure I'll stop by from time to time.

But now... the even worse part... I need to find an apartment.  I've got 2 possibilities at the moment, so we'll see how those go.

So I've seen The Dark Knight, Wall-E, and the newest National Treasure movie recently.  I'd put them in about that order too.

Dark Knight was a phenomenal movie.  Heath Ledger was excellent, the twists and turns kept everyone excited right till the very end, and it makes me excited for the 3rd movie (Riddler, anyone?).

Wall-E is very cute, but also very sad.  As Logan put it, "It makes you want to go out and plant a tree"... which is very true.  Pixar definitely took a step into the political/environmental realm with this one.

National Treasure... well, if you've seen the first one, you've seen this one.  Different story, different puzzles, same concept (even the same "fire wall" thing in the end).  I didn't really enjoy it too much.

I think that's about all for now... I'll try and update this a little more.
