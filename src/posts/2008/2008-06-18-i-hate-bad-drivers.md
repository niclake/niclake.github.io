You know what really grinds my gears?  
  
Thank you, Family Guy, for that great line, but it's truly about the only way I feel right now...  
  
I'm honestly sick and tired of bad drivers out on the roads. Usually, it's not too bad, but today, for whatever reason, I just got really fed up with it.  
  
I've determined that most bad driving is attributed to a handful of things... 1) age (I believe there's a bell curve, where the youngins start off bad, get better, and then worse again as they get older), 2) laziness (more on this in a moment), and 3) attempting to multi-task.  
  
Let's start with 3. How many times have you been driving along with traffic at speed, when suddenly you come across a guy in the left lane doing about 5mph less than everyone else? You sneak around him ever so carefully, only to realize that he's sitting there jawing away with someone on the phone.  
  
Now, I'm at fault with talking on the phone sometimes when I drive... but anyone who's ever talked to me when I'm on the road probably has heard me say "What?" or "Can you repeat that?" a handful of times... it's because I'm not paying attention to the conversation. I'm trying to drive.  
  
The one that really makes me laugh, though, are the women (or, if that's the way they swing, men) that are applying makeup as they drive to work/home/wherever. Lady, the way your driving, you're just doing the job for the people at the funeral home. Seriously... I'm more scared of these people than I am of drunk drivers... then again, I haven't been around a drunk driver in a while.  
  
Back to the lazy ones. These are the ones that I run across \*every day\*. And you do too. Driving to work today, I'm in my turn lane, I have a green light. Guy coming at me has his signal on to turn the same direction as me. Great, fine. I turn, he turns. Everything's fine. Suddenly, I hear breaks squeal. I look back, and here's this dude flipping me off because we turned the same direction at the same time. The difference? I turned into my lane. He turned into... well, not his lane.  
  
Americans (and possibly others out there) are so stinkin' lazy that they can't take the time to put 2 hands on the wheel, slow down 2 or 3 mph, and turn into their own lanes. It's not really that difficult, is it?  
  
Well, needless to say, this guy was obviously PO'd. He followed me to work, then got out of his vehicle and started yelling at me for doing... well, what the law says I should. He told me he was going to report me to the po-po, but I know that the intersection I turned at has a camera there, so I'll be fine. Maybe he'll even get a ticket, who knows.  
  
Has anyone ever considered putting sensors in cars, then giving those cars to people for a week and having them do their driver's training that way? Think about it... when you were in driver's ed, or taking a driving test, you probably did 10-and-2, full 2 second stops, and all that jazz. When you're alone? No way. Put those sensors in cars, have people drive around, and then review the data and see how they really did. This would probably be really complicated and unpractical (not to mention expensive), but I truly think that to get an accurate test of someone's driving ability, you have to put them in real life situations... and you don't have someone with a separate brake on their side all the time (though that is hilarious... I've ridden in one of those cars before and toyed w/ the driver. :-P ).  
  
So basically, what I have to say is this. If you're worried about being able to get to the grocery store because of your age/driving ability, call someone. I'm sure they'd help. Do your makeup at home. If you can't focus on the road enough to talk to someone, pull over. And if you're turning, don't hit my car... pull into your own lane like you're supposed to.  
  
Blech.
