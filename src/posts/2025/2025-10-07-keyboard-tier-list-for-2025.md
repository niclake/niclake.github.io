Each September, [the Relay podcast network](https://www.relay.fm) rallies support for the life-saving mission of [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital®](https://www.stjude.org) during Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. One of the ways that they make it fun & engaging is by encouraging their listeners to run their own fundraisers, complete with their own sets of giveaways and milestones.

The `#keyboards` channel of the server always manage to come together and set silly milestones; many of us will do things that are VERY inconvenient to type with for a week, once a certain amount has been raised. This year's fundraiser was aptly named ***"#Keyboards Suffers; Kids Win"*** I still owe a week of typing on a keyboard in the standard QWERTY layout (because [I'm a weirdo that uses Colemak](/colemak/)).

One of the early milestones this year was "everyone make your own keyboard tier lists", where we rank the boards that we have. I've done this exercise before, and it's *tough* - trying to pick out my favorite, when all of the boards are so drasticaly different, is quite a challenge. I'm incapable of doing a true "1 to however many" ranking, but I've found I'm able to easily put them into ranked groups.

### The Unbuilt Boards

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/alpha28.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Alpha28 keyboard"
%}

#### Alpha28

- Layout: Other (smol boy)
- Switches: Cherry Speed Silvers
- Keycaps: OEM WoB

This one used to work just fine, but the case on it was just a bunch of acrylic pieces stacked together. I used my 3D printer to make a new case for it, thinking that moving from A to B would be a quick thing. Alas, I must desolder every switch, so I can remove it from the plate, so I can put it in the new plate for the new case. Not difficult, just time consuming. I'll get around to it eventually

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/masonry.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of a mockup of the Masonry keyboard"
%}

#### Masonry

- Layout: 40% (weirdo)
- Switches: Rollers
- Keycaps: DSA Ergo Blanks

This definitely falls into the "weird keyboard" category. It's like a run of the mill 40% keyboard, but uses the different sized keycaps to make it mold more fully into the rectangular case. My friend [Ian](https://www.youtube.com/c/IanOfEarth) printed me a case for this, and I'm super excited to use it.

Problem is, this is a true kid, requiring me to solder diodes in place for every switch. And that terrifies me. Probably super easy, just time consuming, but it's new and uncharted territory I have yet to discover.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/reviung41.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of an example of the Reviung41 keyboard"
%}

#### Reviung41

- Layout: 40% ergo
- Switches: JWICK Taros
- Keycaps: Artifact Shield Purple-on-Black

Another "diodes and all" kit that I need to put together. I have a custom printed high-profile (i.e. it has walls) case for this one as well.

I should really just set aside time to do these, huh?

### The Wife's Boards

At a certain point, I convinced my wife to try out one of my keyboards "just to see what it's like". Then I showed her various websites with keyboard and keycap offerings "just to see what's out there". Now she's the primary user of 3 of the keyboards in the collection.

I'm doing something right.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/tab.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my wife's Tab 90M keyboard"
%}

#### Vortex Tab 90M

- Layout: 100% / 1800
- Switches: Cherry Blacks
- Keycaps: DSA Astrolokeys

This was the second keyboard I ever purchased, used for gaming / home office. The 1800 layout is probably my favorite of the "big" layouts; if it's gonna have all the keys, I'd much prefer they're all compacted down on one another. My wife saw the Astrolokeys set and went "oooo pretty", so I gave her this board to put it on.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/dr70.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my wife's DR-70 keyboard"
%}

#### DR-70F

- Layout: 70%
- Switches: Gateron Beer
- Keycaps: Drop DCX Latte

I showed this one to my wife, and she thought it was interesting from a "oh so it doesn't have a numpad on it?" sense. She also loved the orange color, as it was perfect for fall. I went all in with the switches and keycaps, turning this into her "Pumpkin Spice Latte / Pumpkin Beer" keyboard.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/qk100.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my wife's QK100 keyboard"
%}

#### QK100

- Layout: 100% / 1800
- Switches: TKC Tangerines
- Keycaps: XDA Halloween

My wife currently has this on her desk, because surprise, it's almost Halloween. I love building themed boards for her, and I think she has more fun engaging with the keyboard hobby from this angle.

---

### The Infrequent Boards

The boards that have layouts I don't like as much anymore, have keycaps or switches I'm ambivalent about, or have been supplanted by something newer. For whatever reason, taking these off the shelf isn't a big priority.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/ctrl.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Drop CTRL keyboard"
%}

#### Drop CTRL

- Layout: TKL (80%)
- Switches: Cherry Clears
- Keycaps: Domikey Dolsh Green

A gift from a friend. I'm a "layout collector", so having a real TKL in my collection was something I jumped at. It's *much* larger than the boards I typically use, but with a little TLC, I could definitely find a good use for this one.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/boardwalk.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Boardwalk keyboard"
%}

#### Boardwalk + KBDfans 5°

- Layout: 60% ortholinear
- Switches: Zaku IIs
- Keycaps: KAT Cyberspace

My first build - every other board I'd purchased up to this point was a prebuilt. I remember the abject terror I felt when trying to pick out the exact right parts I would need, making uninformed decisions on switches or a switch plate, and just hoping for the best. Turned out great, though, and was my main keyboard for over 3 years (until I REALLY got the hobby itch).

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/dz60.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my DZ60 keyboard"
%}

#### DZ60 + Tofu60 Acrylic

- Layout: 60%
- Switches: Zakus
- Keycaps: GMK CYL Oblivion

My second build, and the one that replaced my first prebuilt board (a Vortex Pok3r). As my collection grew, it sat a bit unused and collecting dust, but I just switched out the keycaps & lubricated the stabilizers last month, and that's made a *huge* difference. I'm already looking forward to the next time this board makes its way onto my desk.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/elora.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Elora keyboard"
%}

#### SplitKB Elora

- Layout: 60% Split Ergo
- Switches: Kailh Box Heavy Yellows
- Keycaps: GMK Dots 2

I desperately want to love this board. I pre-loved this board so much that I made custom walnut cases/bases for the halves. I just... don't know if I like true split keyboards. Ergo is one thing, but a split, I get in my head about positioning, angles, and whatever else, without actually enjoying the typing experience. This one also has a LOT of keys, and had a pre-defined layout I tried to adapt and didn't really enjoy. I need to wipe the whole layout and start fresh, and see if maybe that helps my enjoyment factor any.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/foldkb.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my  keyboard"
%}

#### KeebIO FoldKB

- Layout: 60% Split
- Switches: Gateron Pro Yellow
- Keycaps: DSA Berry Yogurt

I won this board at my first ever keyboard meetup - everyone got drawn for a door prize, and when it was my turn, I thought "ooo a new keyboard"! Took me quite a while to actually go through the process to set it up (I'm sensing a theme). I simply need to spend more time with this board. Love the switches, love the look, but again, it's another true split board, and I've yet to vibe with it as much as I hoped.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/cerberus.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Cerberus keyboard"
%}

#### Pikatea Cerberus

- Layout: 65%
- Switches: Kailh Choc Jade
- Keycaps: Chocfox CFX White Blanks

I met Jack (Pikatea) at the Iowa Keyboard Meetups. Really nice guy, making some really bizzare keyboards. This one isn't bizzare, but it did have a feature I long wanted in a 60/65%, which is a split space, so when I saw this prototype he had, I requested one instantly. This was the first board I soldered, so that was a fun learning experience. I need to fix one key, and figure out a good way to mount the board into the case, before I use it again.

---

### The Rotational Boards

Every Monday, I have a little reminder pop up telling me to switch out my keyboards for something new. The remaining boards on this list are the ones I tend to gravitate towards, for one reason or another.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/bully.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Bully keyboard"
%}

#### CBKBD Bully

- Layout: 40%
- Switches: Gateron Oil Kings
- Keycaps: SA Mizu R3

My first actually built/used "smol boy" on the rankings. The Bully is nice, because it was designed to use keycaps from a full size kit, while still retaining the basic layout of a 40% keyboard (i.e. no numrow). While it's my lowest ranked small board, it's certainly still a board I enjoy using regularly.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/prom.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Promenade keyboard"
%}

#### Promenade + Tofu Redux

- Layout: 60% ortholinear
- Switches: Gateron Raws
- Keycaps: KAM Command

The board that replaced the Boardwalk. The Promenade was a re-release of that general layout, after the company behind the Boardwalk went belly-up. I always thought having just 4 buttons in the middle vs. 6 would be plenty, so this was a great opportunity to give that a shot (and I was right). Also, the Gateron Raws feel/sound amazing on this board.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/prime-e.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Prime_E keyboard"
%}

#### Prime_E

- Layout: 40% ergo
- Switches: custom JWICK stem + Cherry housing
- Keycaps: KAT Iron

My newest board, and a budding favorite. I had another cheap board that I'd been trying to sell for ages, and someone offered this in a trade straight-up. The customized switches he provided are certainly interesting, and I have no complaints.

---

### The Core Boards

Do I need "Rotational" and "Core"? Probably not. But these boards make their way onto my desk more often than the previous grouping, so here we are.

#### Mode SixtyFive

- Layout: 65%
- Switches: Mode Tomorrow Tactiles
- Keycaps: GMK WoB

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/candybar.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Candybar keyboard"
%}

My first "luxury" purchase. There certainly are more keyboards out there that are more expensive... hell, even the SixtyFive had options that were vastly more expensive than my version (which was literally the cheapest you could get at the time). But being able to pick out all the components, having the little walnut strip to match my desk... this was a treat for myself, and I'm glad I went with what I did.

#### Candybar Lefty

- Layout: 50%
- Switches: Kailh Pro Purple
- Keycaps: GMK Sumi

This is the board that's currently on my desk as I type this post. A 40% with a numpad - how novel! This board is a chonky boy, one of the heavier ones I own, and I love the color scheme. I really need to replace these switches, because as much as I enjoy using this board, I don't care for these switches as all. They're quite spongy/squishy feeling.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/libramini.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Libra Mini keyboard"
%}

#### Libra Mini

- Layout: 40% ergo
- Switches: Neo Whites
- Keycaps: Drop + Matt3o MT3 3277

A bit more of an opinionated ergonomic layout, the Libra Mini also has a bit of slope to each half of the board. It's not much, but it's definitely noticable. The joystick is a small novelty that I have yet to fully implement; I need to re-flash the firmware on the board to unlock it. Once I do, I'm going to have that be a mouse, and if it works as I hope it will, this will probably be my main travel board (not that I travel much).

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/nk65superuser.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my NK65 Superuser keyboard"
%}

#### NK65 Superuser

- Layout: 65%
- Switches: Emerald Silks
- Keycaps: KAM Superuser

Was originally up in my "Rotational Boards" section, but this is truly a core board for one reason - it's the one that remains set with QWERTY as the default for use with my gaming PC. Other boards could certainly fill in for gaming, but it's easy enough to grab this one off the wall and plug it in for a gaming session.

---

### The Favorite Boards

Here we are, the top of my list. If someone forced me to get rid of the vast majority of my boards, these are the ones that I wouldn't even consider parting with.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/planck.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Planck keyboard"
%}

#### Drop Planck

- Layout: 40% ortholinear
- Switches: BSUN Pines
- Keycaps: KAT Explosion

This is the board that took the keyboard hobby from "well I have a couple" to "ok yeah I'm a collector now". I'd long been interested in a 40% board, and the Planck is usually available on-demand from Drop, so I finally snatched one up. Using this is what really drove me to embracing keyboard layers, and most of my boards now utilize similar layers and combos from what I came up with here. (Also, the Pines are absolutely incredible switches.)

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "keyboards/planck.png",
  position: "banner",
  alt: "My Planck layout",
  caption: "My Planck layout, showcasing the layers and combos I utilize."
%}

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/j42kbm.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my J42Kbm keyboard"
%}

#### J42Kbm

- Layout: 40% ortholinear
- Switches: Gateron Green Apples
- Keycaps: DSA Hana

A newer entry to the collection, and the first of mine that features a [Happy Hacking Keyboard, or HHKB, layout](https://hhkb.io/layout/). It's also a chonky board, and the purple is just divine looking; photos do NOT do it justice.

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/sonnet.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Sonnet keyboard"
%}

#### Mode Sonnet

- Layout: 75%
- Switches: BSUN Strawberry Wine
- Keycaps: KAT Space Dust

If you don't give 2 shits about drama, go ahead and keep scrolling to the next board. Otherwise, stick around for the crazy world of "keyboard group buys post-pandemic".

---

This board has so many stories attached to it.

- Like the SixtyFive, it's a bit more of a premium board... but I got it at a DEEP discount, because someone just didn't like it and wanted to sell.
- It came with the Strawberry Wine switches, but the board was littered with a bunch of random switches in random places as well. Odd.
- The person who had lubricated the stabilizers had put *so much* lubricant on them that they basically stuck together, so every time I pressed the space bar it was like a memory foam pillow pushing it back up.

Also, the Space Dust keycaps have their own "fun" story.

- Purchased as part of a group buy on 5/24/2021
- Went through production hell, post-COVID manufacturing issues, and long periods of 0 communication
- Finally begin shipping to customers in 2024
- At some point in the previous 3 years, the US vendor did a purchase system transition; those of us with Space Dust orders can see our orders, but can't confirm them, can't update our addresses, and more. So now we are wondering if they'll even reach us.
- Other retailers worldwide got their orders + extras, but the US vendor had unexpected delays
- US vendor's orders ship on a container ship. Gets to port in California. Sits for 3 weeks. Then we find out, oh no, they've been returned to China because they were packed in shipping containers filled with illegal cotton. ***ILLEGAL COTTON!*** I wish I was making that up.
- Meanwhile, I realize I need some additional kits, and since the US is the final vendor, I'm unsure if any of the ones I need will be available. For that matter, will the ones I even ordered be the ones I need?
- Place an order for my kits that I want through the Canadian vendor, because they have them in stock, and I figure I can re-sell the ones from my US order.
- 4 days later, Canadian vendor says "whoopsie we're all out" and cancels my order.
- US order ships! To my old address! Because even though I emailed the vendor 3 separate times about updating my address, and got confirmation 3 separate times, their system still pulled addresses from the old purchase system!
- Cue a very upset email to the vendor.
- I manage to get ahold of my old neighbors, who agree to porch pirate the box if it shows up at my old address.
- Which turns out to be unnecessary, because even though we'd been gone for over a year at that point, my old mail carrier is an absolutely incredible human being, realized it was meant for me, looked up my address manually, and forwarded it for me.[^1]
- And within the span of 2 days, 2 boxes arrive on my front porch; the original box, that had gotten forwarded to me, and a new box, that the vendor has apparently ALSO shipped out, but never notified anyone.
- When asked about returning it, the vendor said (I'm paraphrasing, but not very much) "Just keep it, we're fuckin' tired of dealing with this kit, Merry Christmas"
- It is now 7/2/2024, or 1,136 days later, and these pretty little pieces of plastic have finally arrived.

[^1]: Both of our mail carriers that my wife and I have had since we've been in houses have been incredible. The extra work that they do on behalf of their customers, vs. the work that's done by those who came before or any subs, is SO noticable, and I appreciate them so much. If you have a good one, tell them.

Anyway, I love this board, I love these caps, and the story surrounding this board is something I am thankfully able to laugh about now. ***If you forced me to pick just one keyboard from my collection, this is the one I'd pick.***

{% include 'image.njk',
  src: "/keyboards/qull.jpg",
  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Qull keyboard"
%}

#### CBKBD Qull

- Layout: 35% / QAZ
- Switches: Gateron Smoothies
- Keycaps: GMK Nautilus

You thought the other boards were small... get a load of this one.

I waited a long time to start using this board, mostly because I was skeptical about the practicality of the QAZ layout (the Q, A, and Z keys are "gone", but exist where the Esc, Tab, and Shift keys are). After using 40s for so long, though, I was able to pick it up really quick. Also, the Gateron Smoothie switches are some of my favorites, which makes this tiny board an absolute delight to type on. Also, the GMK Nautilus keycaps were the caps that got me into the hobby in the first place; I saw them, and went "oh I want those", bought a Pok3r to put them on, and the rest is history.

---

There you have it - my rankings/groupings of all of my (current) keyboards. Let me know if you have any questions, or want to know more about any of the boards in my collection.
