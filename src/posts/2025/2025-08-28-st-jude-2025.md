Each September, [the Relay podcast network](https://www.relay.fm) rallies support for the life-saving mission of [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital®](https://www.stjude.org) during Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. By joining with them, we can all help make more cures possible. Together, we can help give families facing childhood cancer more tomorrows.

Since 2019, [Relay has raised over $4,000,000 for St. Jude](https://relay.experience.stjude.org/#). They're aiming to raise (at least) another $700,000 this year, but I predict that they're going to smash right through that once again.

In 2023, I was able to help raise over $1,000 as part of the drive. This year, I'm aiming a bit higher - I'd love to hit $2,500.

While I don't have any giveaways to do this year, I do have some milestones that I'd love to hit.

- $250: I will match the first $250 donated.
- $1,000: I will bust out my old Twitch stream, and play some spooky game for Halloween (I hate scary anything).
- $2,000: I will get the St. Jude logo tattoo'd on my person.
- $2,500: I, a sedentary creature, will sign up for & run a 5k.

I threw this together real quick yesterday, so if you have any other milestone ideas, or rewards I could do for certain donation thresholds, I'd love to hear about them. If they don't make it in this year, I could at least have that ready to go for next year.

#### And remember... it's for the children.
