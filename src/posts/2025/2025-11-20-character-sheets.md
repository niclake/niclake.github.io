Two random quotes I've heard from people today:

> I need to learn how to believe people who say the reason you’re stressed out is because you care, while to me it feels like I’m stressed because I’m bad at my job. Believing people is hard.

and

> [re: someone telling them "You're a lovely person who is generous with your time"] It's all luck. Luck and distraction tactics.

My response to the latter, which applies to the former:

> "I keep rolling nat 20s on charisma checks" vs. "I'm such a good egg that my Persuasion modifier is a +15"
> sometimes it's hard to read our own character sheets

We don't always know why we're viewed a certain way by others, and sometimes it's REALLY hard to accept it as truth. Accepting compliments when you don't feel good about yourself isn't natural to many people.

Just remember - light radiates outward. You might be shining brighter than you realize. If someone holds a mirror up for you, it's ok to believe what you see.
