As someone that's somewhat new to 3D printing, I'm still trying to figure out what the best places to find STL files to print are. Sometimes I'll find something good on one site, but not on another, and it's frustrating to go from site to site.

Alfred coming through yet again for me. [I created a simple workflow](https://github.com/niclake/alfred-3dp-stl-search) that will take in your query and search MakerWorld, Printables, and STLFinder, opening all of those links in new tabs within your default browser. Simple, easy, helpful.

You can view the latest release & download the workflow [on GitHub](https://github.com/niclake/alfred-3dp-stl-search/releases/latest).
