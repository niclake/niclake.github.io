This is a story about baking bread.

I wouldn't say that I have capital-A Anxiety, but I do get anxious, just like everyone else. I'm prone to impatience, and wanting to have things now now now.

I remember the last time I did a job search, and knew that I was going to hear back from the hiring manager. They told me "End of Day Tuesday", which I took to mean "by 5". So I'm attached to my phone and email, waiting to hear something. It's 2, nothing. 3, nothing. 4, still nothing. 4:30, what's the hold-up. 4:45, oh god, where are they? 5, 5:05, 5:10, oh no what happened?

The company is based on the west coast, 2 hours behind me. I got the call at 6:15pm my time.

Anxiety sucks. It's all consuming, and ruins hours, days, weeks, months. With [my ADHD](/blog/tags/#adhd), I've had to learn how to yank myself out of anxious spirals and stay in the moments. It's not always successful. I've cut vacations short because a package was supposed to be delivered & needed a signature; of course it didn't arrive until 7pm. I hover around V, telling her "be careful!", instead of letting her experience the joy of (checks notes) climbing on the side of the couch.

And don't even get me started on being anxious about Thing A, only to have that be perfectly fine, but Thing B comes along and bites you in the ass instead while you weren't paying attention.

This is a story about anxiety.

I was so excited to bake sourdough for the first time. My wife and I both made starters ("Mr. X" and "Kevin Bacon"), and today was the day.

Except, the only vessel I had to bake in was my cooking pot. You know, the ones with 6" high walls. How the *fuck* am I supposed to get the bread into that without burning myself?

Pot & lid into the 500Â° oven to preheat. Dough laid out on the parchment paper. I'm starting to feel anxious. I burned myself really badly once when I was 14, and I had no desire to go through that again. Damnit, why didn't I get one of [those cool Dutch ovens to bake on???](https://a.co/d/93K8vVP)[^1]

[^1]: Editor's note: these work VERY well, highly recommend.

Everything's preheated. Here I go.

Pull the pot out of the oven. Take off the lid and set it aside. Take off the oven mitts, and grasp corners of the parchment paper. Mild hyperventilating. You can do it you can do it you can do it.

Lift.

Move.

Drop, maybe a tad aggressively.

It's in! I didn't touch the pot! Hooray! High fived my wife! Celebrations all around! Woohoooooo!!!!!

Grab the (preheated) pot lid with my bare hand.

This is a story, and I'll let you decide if you want to take anything meaningful from it.[^2]

[^2]: Epilogue - Burned the fuck out of my hand. Blisters everywhere, hurt to grab anything or type or whatever. Miserable for about 10 days. Haven't baked a loaf of sourdough since.
