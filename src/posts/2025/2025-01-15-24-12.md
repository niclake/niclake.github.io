The setting: college. Early December. Not quite finals time, but getting close. Some weekday afternoon.

I'm cramming for an 8am test the following morning. I'm sick and feeling exhausted, so I have a few cans of Mt. Dew for the energy boost. I can stay awake. I can do this.

Next thing I know, I'm waking up, having gone head-down on my textbook. I look at the clock. 7:50.

Oh man oh jeez oh fuck.

Grab my jacket, grab my bag. Sprint across campus. Run into the building, up the stairs, to the classroom. The door is locked. Why is the door locked? let-me-in.gif

My phone buzzes. It's my friend. "Hey where you at? We're about to hop on CoD, you wanna play?"

And that is why, to this day, every digital clock I own is set to military time.
