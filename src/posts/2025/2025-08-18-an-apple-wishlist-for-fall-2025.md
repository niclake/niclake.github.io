Back in the summer of 2024, [I wrote out a little Apple wishlist](/an-apple-wish-list/) of some things I really would've liked to see. With new iPhones & other devices coming out, I thought I'd revisit those, see if we got anything, and add new things.

- **A standalone Touch ID sensor, and/or one that's baked in to the Magic Trackpad** - haven't gotten this, but I did build my own that's plugged in to my Mac Mini. So, close enough. (I still think Apple should go this, though.)

  caption: "I harvested a TouchID sensor from a Magic Keyboard, and stuffed it into a little 3D printed container. I also sunk a threaded insert juuuuust a bit too far."
%}

- **Apple Music "shuffle by album" on iPhone** - still nope. Thankfully, [the Albums app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-music-library-player/id1469948986) continues to serve me well.
- **Apple Watch grocery list issues** - that was a random bug I was able to solve by hard-deleting both of them.
- **An iPhone Pro Mini** - give it to meeeeeeee
- **Devices using Lightning** - have they finally gotten the Magic Trackpad and Keyboard onto USB-C?
- **Sharing anything via iCloud** - still a huge hassle. Also, same with taking a photo on your phone and having it available on your Mac via Photos within any decent time frame.
- **Extra Small Widgets** - I'm still lusting for this. It would change up how I use my phone completely.

I do have a couple of new additions as well:

- If I have multiple home screens on my iPhone, I want an option to always go back to the first one every time I unlock my phone.
- Allow any Setting to be mapped to a Control Center widget. Let me drill down and choose it, then either make it a button, a slider, or something that invokes a menu. Easy. (Some prime options: ringer volume or silence unknown callers)

What's on your wishlist?
