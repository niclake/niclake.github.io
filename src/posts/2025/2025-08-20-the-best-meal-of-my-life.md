I forgot our first wedding anniversary.

Specifically, I forgot to book us a reservation at a nice restaurant in Des Moines. Don't really know why; I was excited to celebrate, the place my wife wanted to go looked really good, I'd known that I needed to make a reservation for months, and... I just didn't.

When I called that place about booking a reservation, naturally they were full up for the entire weekend. Fuck.

So, I did a little research. Found another spot that looked to be just as good/fancy. They had openings, so I reserved it. I could tell that my wife was disappointed, but we went anyway.

We got in there, and the place was practically empty[^1], so we got excellent service from the host, the waiter, and the bar staff. They had a multi-course (5? 7? I can't recall) tasting menu of Mediterranean-but-not-Italian dishes. A lot of it was north African-inspired, with some Spanish, French, and Middle Eastern influences. They also had a wine paring to go along with it. It was our first anniversary; fuck it, why not?

[^1]: My wife and I have a knack for showing up at places at the perfect times to beat the rushes. I don't know how we consistently do this, but it's been a non-stop feat for a dozen years now.

When I tell you that this remains one of the best meals of my life, I'm not even kidding. I was full but not stuffed, pleasantly buzzed... it was perfect.

We went back to that restaurant together another time for Valentine's Day. Different food theme this time, can't recall what it was. They didn't have a tasting menu this time, but when we mentioned how much we enjoyed that last time, the waiter was like "hang on", ran to the back, came back out, "yeah, Chef says he's happy to do that with our current menu." Hell yeah. Food was incredibly delicious.

This time, the bar staff discovered that we worked at a brewery in town. Wanted to talk all about Scottish and English ales. Had a bunch of bottles. "Can I share some of these with you?" I shit you not, we had over a dozen glasses on our table and the next table over, with samples of Scottish Wee Heavy, English milds, and more. It was nuts.

I was very drunk. Thank god for Uber.

When I was in Boy Scouts, our troop went camping every month from September to May. We'd go all over the state of Iowa, and sometimes into Minnesota or Wisconsin. Tons of cool experiences, and generally just a nice opportunity to get out of the house for a weekend with friends.

One winter trip, I don't exactly recall where we went, one of the adults made Dutch oven chili. It sat and cooked all day while we had snowball fights, looked at a bison, and did who knows what else. Beef, beans, tomatoes, whatever else. I don't think there was anything special in it, just your generic run-of-the-mill chili.

Best chili I've ever had in my life. Better than my own. Better than any chili I've ever had at any cook-off. Why? Couldn't tell you. Was it because it was below freezing outside, and we're able to hold the bowls to warm our hands and eat the chili to warm us from the inside? Probably!

I was just in San Francisco for a work trip, and went to a Thai place a half block from the hotel for the final dinner in town. It was just me and one other guy on my team.

When we found it, we were skeptical. It was down this alley, tucked away from a busy street (we'd had numerous jokes already from the week about sketchy alleyways). We got there right as they opened, though, so we popped in and gave it a shot.

[The menu was interesting](https://hedverythaisf.com/san-francisco-downtown-hed-verythai-food-menu); they had appetizers, but then dinners were a fully curated affair. You could choose from one of 8 different options (4 set and 4 seasonal), with different types of protein, a side, a soup, and more.

Everything was delicious. Fresh, spicy, hot and cold, crispy and soft. It hit every note possible. It was SO good. If my wife and I ever make the trip out to SF together, that'll be the first place I take her.[^2]

[^2]: Another restaurant called [Burma Love](https://www.burmalove.co/burma-love-downtown#location-menu) will be the second.

It's funny, I know where and when the best food I ever tasted was. I can remember so many things about the experiences surrounding those meals; what I saw, what I heard, what I smelled. I remember that those things tasted delicious. But sometimes, _I don't even remember what I ate_.

But maybe that's the point.
