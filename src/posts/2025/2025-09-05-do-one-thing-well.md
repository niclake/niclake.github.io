Years ago, my friend Patrick said or shared the phrase ***"do one thing well"***. I don't remember exactly what we were talking about, but the concept is simple; if you are buying an item to do something, it should JUST do that thing, and not eleventythousand different things. If it does too much, then that's extra points of failure down the road, or features you're paying for that will never get used.

An easy example is our Instant Pot. It's a pressure cooker, and a good one. It also has a sauté function, which is convenient. It can also make hard boiled eggs, rice, *yogurt?!?*, and more. I paid extra for this model, vs. the simple basic model that I think just has pressure cook & sauté.

Reader, guess how many times I've done *ANYTHING* with our Instant Pot that wasn't pressure cooking or sautéing.

"Do one thing well". Be excellent at that thing. Be so excellent that [some people buy a whole bunch because they can't find anything like it and want to have spares if and when it breaks (again)](https://atp.fm/334)[^1]

[^1]: I'll never go that hard for cheese graters, but hey, to each their own.

I use Safari as my main browser across all my devices. It syncs between all of them, has features I enjoy, and works well for my purposes.

I use Chrome for work and development, because that's the standard across the board.

I use Firefox to watch YouTube, because ad blockers still consistently work there, AND it has the added benefit of siloing YouTube off from my every day browsing, so I don't get sucked in and spend hours lost in random videos[^2].

[^2]: I'm still missing those hours of sleep. If found, please return.

The problem:
- Any time I click on a URL, it goes to Safari. This is good, except...
- If I click on a link in Slack, I always want it to be in Chrome, and...
- If I open a YouTube link, I want it to be in Firefox.

The "solution", up until this week, has been:
- Right-click > Copy links in Slack, move to Chrome, paste, go
- If a YouTube link ever opens, copy it, go to Firefox, paste, go

Functional? Yes. Annoying? Also yes.

I happened to gripe about this on the [Relay member's Discord](), hoping someone would have a solution for me.

Enter: [Choosy](http://choosy.app). (Thank you, [Ben](), for pointing this out to me.)

Choosy is the *perfect* app for me, for this particular use case. Set up your browsers, set up the roles, and off you go. My rules are simple:

- If the URL contains `youtube.com` or `youtu.be`, open it in Firefox
- If the URL comes from Slack, open it in Chrome
- Otherwise, open it in Safari

It does one thing well. It's exactly what I need, no more, no less. The perfect app (and an immediate $10 from me).
