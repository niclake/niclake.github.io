My dad's phone "breaks" again. Which, that really just means his phone is doing something unexpected or new. In this case, some notifications settings are weird and need adjusting.

He's well into his 70s, and after years of back and forth, we've come to an understanding - I'll just fix the problem, and then I'll explain the issue if and only if it's relevant to you; otherwise, we'll just leave it be. So I adjust the settings and hand the phone back. It takes me maybe 30 seconds.

"Thanks, Nic. You make it seem so easy." And he's right. *It IS easy... **for me***. But it's rooted in decades of computer experience, a dozen years of iPhone use, & all the tech podcasts and Discords and whatnot that I follow. It's **easy**, but it's _not_ **simple**.

I'm struggling mightly with my weight. I could chalk it up to "Dad Bod", but it's more than that. A wonderful cocktail of ADHD, a compulsion to always be doing something, watching tons of sports, and a "new day" opening up to me when my kid goes to bed for the night.

Every night, it seems, I find myself snacking. Sometimes it's a protein bar. Sometimes it's popcorn. Or chips and salsa. Or hot chocolate. Or trail mix. Some nights, it's _all_ of that. I did the math one night, and it was over 1,200 calories that I snacked on between 7:30pm and when I finally went to bed.

The answer is so **simple**: Don't eat after dinner. But with the aforementioned cocktail of Stuff™, it's not **easy** for me to act (or not act) upon.

Things that are easy aren't necessarily simple things. Things that are simple things aren't necessarily easy for everyone. Having that grace in both directions, both for others and for yourself, is *so* important.

This is not a brilliant "ah-ha!" moment. Many others before me have had this exact realization. I've probably had this realization. But in the context of my family, of my health, of habits I'm trying to break or nurture, this "ah-ha" moment sounded like a gong going off in my head.

Maybe it will for you too.
