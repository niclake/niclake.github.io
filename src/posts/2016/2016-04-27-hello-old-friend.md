Man, it's been a long time since I've blogged. Been a long time since I've taken the time out of my life to blog.

So many new things have happened, or are happening currently. It's been a pretty insane whirlwind, so let me tell you what's been happening recently.

- **I moved to the Quad Cities in October.** Becca lives down here, and I decided that it was time to live closer together. Driving 2 hours and only seeing each other on the weekends was a giant pain that we dealt with for over a year and a half. Blargh. To that end, I quit my job and...
- **Started working at the University of Iowa Foundation** as a web developer. Pretty slick gig. <a href="http://uifoundation.org/ai/" target="_blank">I put out a pretty slick new site just recently</a>, and I'm quite proud of it. More on this in just a sec.
- **Becca and I got married!!!** March 5, 2016, we tied the knot at the Figge Art Museum in Davenport, IA. Tremendously dope experience. Went to Sanibel Island, FL and hung out with a bunch of retired old people for our honeymoon.
- (I told you I'd talk about it again in a sec.) **Got let go from my job.** Which really sucks, because that position was one I could've seen myself working at for the rest of my career; great mission, fun atmosphere, etc. I'm super bummed about it, but that's life. As such...
- **I'm on the job hunt.** Trying to find a new job, so I can support the two of us while Becca finishes up getting her chiropractic license. The best thing about it is that we can now literally go anywhere we want, and we're taking full advantage of that.

These last 7 months have just been filled with changes. Most people would say "ups and downs", but I'm attempting to see the positive in all of this. I've been trying to do so in a variety of ways.

- **Apply for jobs like crazy.** This is pretty obvious, I'm sure. But, Becca and I are looking to relocate to the Des Moines area, so it makes it both easier (there's shitloads of developer positions there) and harder (gotta drive 2.5 hours for an interview, and any offer = we gotta move quick quick quick).
- **Stream myself playing video games.** This is actually an interesting hobby of mine; I'm not the greatest, but I try to be entertaining. <a href="http://twitch.tv/PhoenixUNI" target="_blank">You're welcome to come check it out at any point.</a> I play League of Legends, Dark Souls, and whatever other games trip my fancy.
- **Contribute more to open source projects, and/or work on my own programming projects.** I'm terrible about this, and have been since college. I need to get involved in the web community to have a better portfolio to market myself with. Oops.
- **Be a (sometimes too) loving husband.** My wife is the best, and she's about to become a kick-ass chiropractor here in the coming months. She inspires me every day to be a better human being, and to push myself to new heights.

It's terrifying to be a husband, unemployed, with no real sense of what is going to happen in the coming weeks. But I'm excited to see where the future takes us, and how we'll get there.
