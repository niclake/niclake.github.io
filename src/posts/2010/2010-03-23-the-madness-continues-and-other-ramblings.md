For those of you that aren't aware, I need to state a couple of things.

1. I attend the University of Northern Iowa.
2. I am a huge sports fan, especially basketball, baseball, and football.
3. On Saturday, UNI beat Kansas, the overall #1 seed, in the NCAA Tournament!!!!!!!
4. Ali Farokhmanesh is a stud.

![](images/alg_iowa_celebrates-300x220.jpg)I don't mean to bore you non-sports fans... really, I don't... but I am so incredibly amped up about this.  Northern Iowa is in the Sweet 16 for the first time ever.  My team, my school, has made it.  And at long last, we have finally forced everyone at ESPN to stop butchering our player's names and learning how to pronounce them.

Want to look smart at your party on Friday?  Let me help you out...

\- Ali Farokhmanesh (pronounced Fah roke (rhymes with broke) meh nesh, in a short-long-short-long pattern.  FaROKHmaNESH.  Like that.)  You'll hear his name a lot, and if Dick Vitale makes it on the air, you'll hear it pronounced about 20 different ways.

\- Jordan Eglseder (Egg ul seeder) is the big man in the middle.  He's also really ugly, and thus has acquired the nicknames of Sasquatch (from teammates) and Lothar, King of the Hill People (from my sophomore year dorm floor).

\- Kwadzo Ahelegbe (Ka Joe  Uh Hell Ig Baa)  You will hear this name butchered most of all, both first and last.  The one I hear the most is "Ah Hell Leg Ba", when they stress the 3rd syllable.  That's incorrect.  You stress the 2nd syllable, thus getting "Uh Hell Ig Ba".

Oh, and if you hear boos from the crowd after our big Irish guy does something good... you know, the one with the massive sideburns... that's Lucas O'rear.  And we're not booing.  We're yelling "Luuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!"

This is going to be a busy, busy week.  Sorry in advance for all of you that were writing I'd be posting a lot of blog posts... that might not happen.

- School is back in session.  I've made a personal resolve not to slack off.  I've got about 6 weeks of classes to go, and I really want to do solid.  Finished with a 3.27 last semester... having a 3.33 for this semester would be great.
- I'm working a lot.  This helps the first bullet point, since my work consists of me sitting here, refilling printers (which reminds me... good thing too, this one was just about out) and telling people to stop looking at porn.  Ok, not really on the second one, but I totally would if someone was.
- I'm anxiously waiting to hear back from the business I had a job interview with last Thursday.  Ever since I was sitting in the room and found out exactly what the job consisted of, I got suuuuuuuuuuper excited.  This job would be stellar.  Traveling around, meeting new people.  Always a new location practically every day.  A great paycheck (not to mention the free meals/hotels/gas).  Home on the weekends.  What's not to like about that?  The last of their interviews wrapped up today.  120+ applicants, 37 interviews, and they're hiring about 10 or so people.  Ugh, I'm so nervous for this.
- I have 2 excellent opportunities that have presented themselves for this week.  Thursday, President Obama is going to be in Iowa City to speak to students and area citizens (more than likely about the health care plan that was just passed).  I was selected as someone that could potentially receive a ticket to go, and you bet I put in my application for it right away.  Best part = it's free.  I'd just need to drive down there.
- The second opportunity is... I might be going to the Sweet 16 (see random babbling rant above).  Tickets for both Friday games (UNI/Michigan State, and Tennessee/Ohio State), as well as the Elite 8 matchup between the winner of those two games on Sunday, are $166 total.  A bus would transport students down on Friday, and we'd leave right after the game.  If we won, we'd be back on Sunday.  $166 is a lot, especially if UNI were to lose... but it's a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I would seriously kick myself if I didn't go.  We shall see what happens... students were supposed to have their requests in by 5pm today, and I sent an inquiry e-mail at about 9pm.  Oops.

In other news... my iPod died today.  Or as I put it, "it was being dumb".  Anytime hardware isn't broken, but refuses to operate as it should, without user error, it is deemed as "being dumb".  Thankfully, a simple reformat and a 2 hour wait while 90gb of music loaded onto it, and it's good as new.  Huzzah!

I need less expensive hobbies.  I've been researching some of the following, just to see what kinds of things I would like to acquire in the future:

- Guitar equipment.  Still need to spend about $500 on pedals, plus a power supply for them.  I was going to have to buy a new board, but I slashed out purchasing 2 pedals I'd like for now just so I can get the equipment.  Then there's the amp... somewhere between $600 and $1,600, depending on whether I go for a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe or a Vox AC30.
- Camera equipment.  I'll be writing a post on this later... suffice to say, camera equipment is \*not\* cheap.  The body that I'm looking at (Canon 5D Mk II) alone costs $2,500.  Lenses range from $100 for a cheap but highly recommended prime lens to $2,000 for a telephoto zoom lens that I'd need if I ever wanted to get in to sports photography.  And those are relatively cheap lenses too... I'm looking at dropping about $700 on 2 lenses just to get started.  Ooooooouch.
- An iPhone.  I know, Mom, I have other things to buy... but I'm an Apple geek.  I always have been, and probably always will be.  It pains me to be typing on a HP laptop right now, but you work with what you've got.  Someday, maybe when I move to a bigger city that actually has 3G coverage, I would love to acquire an iPhone (or whatever's out by then).  They're amazing little things, and it wouldn't be just some novelty item to me.  I'd definitely make full use of it.
- A new TV.  The TV I have was donated to me by my aunt.  It's got a VHS deck built into it, and the remote is so ghetto, it doesn't even have a volume control on it.  Surprisingly, the picture is quite excellent for being standard def. and as old as it is.  However, I'd really like an upgrade.
- A new car stereo deck.  Being able to plug my iPod straight in and get excellent sound would be ideal.  Instead, I'm utilizing a FM Transmitter that picks up more static and random noise than horse poop picks up flies.  Using a tape deck doesn't work either, since it only sends in mono rather than stereo... boo.
- A new office chair.  This might actually be a feasible purchase, though it'll still run me $100 or so.  I've had my current chair since I got to college in 2005, so that's 5 solid years of use.  Lately, every time I lean back in my chair, there's a loud popping noise as the handle that controls how high your chair is gets stuck on something and then releases.  It's really annoying, especially when trying to woo the ladies.

Oh, and I want a kitty.

See?  Expensive.  Why can't I be into something cheap, like pennies or pogs or stamps or something like that?  Nooooo, I have to go and be all musical and techy and whatnot.

Enough.  Gotta study some more.  Right, Mom?
