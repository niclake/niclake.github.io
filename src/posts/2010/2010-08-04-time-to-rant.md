People that steal are gigantic pieces of shit.

Today was my... I think 3rd run-in ever with thieves.  And I sure hope it's my last.  Such a gigantic pain in the ass.

So I stopped at the corporate office this morning, grabbed a company car, and drove over to our staging area in Des Moines.  On the way, I decided to plug in my iPod and listen to some tunes.  Got to the store, parked my car, put the iPod in the center console, cracked my windows a bit, locked the doors, and went inside.  Came out around noon for lunch, but didn't go near my car.

When I came back out to my car after work, lo and behold, my iPod is gone out of my car, along with the headphones and the auxiliary cable that was with it.  One of my coworkers had his stereo ripped out of his car.

Seriously?!?

Thankfully, the cops showed up and got our statements and info.  Unfortunately, the camera right out by our cars wasn't working, and the other one in the parking lot couldn't get a good view.  But, by piecing a few things together, we've already got leads on who might have stolen it.  A couple dudes were trolling around the area in their car for the better part of 2 hours, and we've got them on at least 2 different cameras.

Odds we catch them?  I'll go 5 to 1.  Odds I ever recover my iPod?  Probably 1,000,000 to 1.  Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu....

I've seriously reached next to me to turn on my iPod/put the headphones in at least a half dozen times tonight as I sit here in the hotel room.  It's not that I'm dependent on it, it's just really weird to not have it.

I had someone ask me once what I would do, if I ever caught a thief and I got to dish out the punishment.  The good person in me said "oh, I'd forgive him as long as I got my stuff back".  The evil person in me said "I'd take a mallet a smash that fuck's hands... see if he can ever grab anything to steal again!!!"  Guess which of those viewpoints I've got right now?  Oooh, or better yet... it's Shark Week this week.  Duct tape some fish or something to the dude's hands, and stick them in the shark tank.

I've had 3 things stolen from me in my lifetime.  The first was my old Huffy Spitfire bike (it was pink... so what?) when I left it outside at night on accident.  The second was a stocking hat that I \*think\* my old roommate, or one of his friends, swiped when he moved out.  And now my iPod.

I'm not really even pissed about this.  Once I got over the initial "WTF" reaction, I calmed down pretty quick.  Woohoo, it's an iPod.  Not the end of the world.  But Lord knows I'd still like to get my hands on the bitch that took it.

I wonder if thief hands taste any different to sharks...
