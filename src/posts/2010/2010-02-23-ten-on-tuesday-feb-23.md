![](http://rootsandrings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/rr10tuesday.jpg?w=125&h=125)Well, someone suggested that I start doing this as a way to increase readers, as well as to let everyone out there know a little more about me.  So without further ado... my first foray into the Ten on Tuesday posts.

**1. What is your favorite flavor of ice cream?** I'm a pretty big sucker for cookie dough.  The dining center here on campus goes through the stuff so fast that I haven't been able to have it in a couple months.  Other acceptable options: mint chocolate chip, Bunny Tracks, and birthday cake.  Om nom nom.

**2. What is your earliest memory?** I very distinctly remember punching a kid in the nose in kindergarten.  (Go ahead and laugh... it's pretty funny now.)  It was sometime in the fall/early winter, and we were coming in from the recess session we had before school began.  Everyone had a general idea of where they were supposed to hang their coats and such, and this kid just came and hung his jacket on my hanger.  MY HANGER!  We got in a little scuffle, one of my arms got free, and I socked him right in the nose.  One of the very very few times I've actually struck someone.  (The kid, Mitch, would actually go on to be one of my really good friends up through the end of high school... I honestly haven't seen him since we left for college.)

Oh, and I also remember being forced to stay in from recess (also in kindergarten) because I didn't want to color my dinosaurs...

**3. What is your earliest memory of a dessert?** My mom has always made yummy bars... caramel and chocolate chips sandwiched between layers of chocolate cake mix.  Amazing.  But actually, my most vivid memory would be when we'd make chocolate chip cookies.  My parents would tell me about "Magic Cookies"... if I stood in front of the oven right after Mom put them in the oven and said "Magic cookies, magic cookies" and then disappeared while they cooked, they'd "magically" turn into MnM Chocolate Chip cookies.  It was amazing!

I'm so doing that to my kids.  Mess with their heads a little.

**4. Do you have any recurring dreams?** For whatever reason, me dreaming about swinging a golf club always goes horribly wrong.  I couldn't tell you what it is that happens, only that I manage to never hit the ball.

**5. Have you ever dreamed about dessert?** Perhaps?  I can't recall.

**6. What is one thing (aside from a cell phone or computer) that you cannot go the entire day without?** Music.  Whether I hum to myself, play air guitar, tap a drum beat on a table, or (best case) have my iPod with me, I really can't go 24 hours without at least thinking about music in some capacity.

**7. What is one dessert you could go your entire life without ever having again?** If oatmeal raisin cookies disappeared off the face of the planet, I promise you I would not be very heartbroken.

**8. If you could go on vacation tomorrow, where would you go? (Assume someone else is footing the bill, but within reason…so “the moon” won’t work)** Someplace out of Iowa.  Obviously.  It's too cold here.  Maybe someplace in the Caribbean... yeah, that would rock.

**9. If you could have any dessert tomorrow, what would you have (assume someone else is buying it for you. Within reason though, no “gold sprinkled ice cream cones.”)** Seriously, what's with the obsession with dessert?  Yikes.  Applebee's has these Blondie dessert things... I haven't had one in forever, but man, I recall that they are absolutely delicious.

**10.  What was your first impression of your significant other? If you’re single, what was your first impression of your best friend?** No significant other right now, so I guess I have to go with best friend... but that's also difficult, since it's hard to really classify who my "best friend" is.  I'll pick my 2 primaries:

Jordan: I thought he was really shy, more shy than I am.  I obviously know better now... haha.  I still laugh sometimes thinking about the freshman version of him, and how much he's changed over the years.  (All this reminds me... I really want to go play disc golf.) Q: I met him one Wednesday at our high school youth group service, when someone was trying to get me plugged in to the music program there.  I thought he rocked at guitar (which he still does), and was honestly slightly intimidated/scared of him (not so much anymore... haha).  I figured he would just be some other adult leader that I'd talk to occasionally, but never really connect with.

**11. What is your first impression of dessert pizza? (Personally, I think it’s weird. I love dessert but I don’t want any on my pizza.)** Godfathers.  Drumline dinners before high school football games.  Getting the bakers to make us 3 pizzas just for us, because we seriously would consume it all between us.  It was all kinds of awesome.  I miss those days.
