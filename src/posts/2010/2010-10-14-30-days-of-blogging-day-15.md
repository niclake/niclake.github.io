I swear, it's getting more and more difficult to keep up with this project.  Midterms will do that to you, I guess.

Day 15: Someone or something you definitely could live without.

**_Drama_**.  Drama drama drama.  Less of it would be super.

One of my exes has been super annoying lately, attempting to cause as much drama in my life as she possibly can.  I don't know why, either.  She's got a guy who cares about her,  I haven't talked to her in ages (and don't care to, for that matter)... so why is she so adamant on trying to make my life hell?

Answer: because she's a woman.  ([Ba doom chhhhhh!](http://www.instantrimshot.com))

I kid, I kid.  But seriously, why?  The only thing I've ever really heard from here is either "zomg I want you back" or "zomg I want you out of my life".  Why would I want to be a part of that?  There's usually a reason someone becomes your ex, yes?  Incompatibility.  Doucheyness (that word looks funny).  Cheating.  Distance.  There's a reason I'm only friends with 1 of my exes, and that's because a) she never wronged me, and b) she seems to still like me enough to still be friends.  Go me.

 

... has anyone else noticed that this "30 days of blogging" project has turned into "30 days of Nic talking about his exes"?  I swear, that wasn't my intention.

Anyway.  No more drama.  Do not want.
