So it seems that lately, Formspring has been "the big thing".  For those that don't know, Formspring is a way for people to ask others questions.  The user answers, and the questions are on display for all to see.  Most people do this anonymously, but others will log in to allow the user to see who's asking the questions.

I'm too lazy to make a Formspring, and I couldn't think of another thing to do for a post today, so I thought I'd let you all ask whatever you wanted.

Things to remember:

1) People of all ages read this blog.

2) My parents also read this blog.

So... ask away, but try to keep it relatively appropriate.  If nothing else, I'll respond to your question in private, but I'll try to leave everything else up for people to see. :-)
