I have a pretty big love/hate relationship with my brain.

See, my brain and I, we've decided that we want to keep our relationship mostly a secret. We try not to see each other outside of work, and often even ignore each other while we are there. Maybe we'll have fleeting moments of energy and connected-ness, but during the day, we could really care less about each other.

It's not until around 10pm that things start to happen. You know, right around the time where everyone's turning in for the evening, closing the doors to the outside world. That's when the brain and I "make magic" together.

.... sickos.

![](images/homer-simpson-wallpaper-brain-10242.jpg)Seriously, though, it amuses me how much I get done after 10pm most nights. Whether it's studying, blogging, reading, or whatever, my "best" work always shows up late in the day... and I'm not really sure why. Fewer distractions from people, the TV, and the internet probably play a big part in that... but I just feel so awake at that time of night, that those 3 hours (till about 1am) are just filled with me always doing things.

My other problem is that once I finally do settle down on one topic to think about/engage in, I'm usually hooked. For a long time. Examples:

- 2 weeks ago, I discovered sabermetrics (Google it). This was right before my fantasy baseball draft happened. I got hooked, and I got hooked hard. I was reading as much as I could about it, calculating out stats of guys that I was debating on drafting. I got absolutely nothing "productive" done that day (and I blame [Bill Simmons](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/simmons/index) for it all). Since then? I've looked at the info... oh, maybe once.
- \- Last night, I got the idea in my head that it was time to revive my old PowerBook. I'm sick of using Windows when I go out and about... there's just nothing appealing about that at all. I'd seriously rather use an old Mac (1.5GHz PowerPC) than a relatively new HP machine running Windows (2.6GHz Intel Dual Core)... and yes, I've tried Linux before. Â So I got my PowerBook out, and spent the course of the evening getting everything back to running relatively quickly and efficiently. I have a new battery that's on the way, so maybe I can be off the power cord for more than 30 minutes at a time. Total time spent? About 3 hours.
- \- When I was a [computer science major](http://www.cs.uni.edu/) here at the university, I had a class in C programming. I'd never programmed before, and so I had the duality of "well, this sucks, but at the same time, it's kinda cool..." going on. Then, about mid-September, it just clicked with me. I loved writing code. I'd pour over my weekly assignments, making sure they worked perfectly, usually submitting them days ahead of my classmates. We had a final project that we had to do for that class, in which we were required to come up with our own ideas for a program, and then make it a reality. Back in those days, I was big into Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) with a couple of my friends, and I decided to make a program that would do all sorts of things for the game: stat generators for characters, dice rollers, treasure calculators, etc. My professor printed out all assignments that were turned into him to hand back. Well, for whatever reason, he decided to print my assignment out 3 times (he tried to blame it on me, but I had nothing to do with it). My code was 97 pages. 291 total pages handed back to me that day. He wasn't very thrilled.
- When I blog, I get on a really big roll. Especially now. Before, I used to write everything right in the Wordpress dashboard, and I'd find myself getting easily distracted by everything. Now, I'm using [Writeroom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) in order to keep me focused better. However, as I'm sure you've probably seen, my [last](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/ill-put-it-out-in-your-eye/) [two](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/ass-kickin/) posts have been kinda lengthy.
- Even studying, to some degree, can be this way. When I get in the right mood, and sit down to look over my homework/reading, I'll get totally immersed in what I'm doing, and not only get more out of what I'm doing, but get it done a lot faster too. (Sadly, there's no known catalyst for making this particular mood come about, which is kinda unfortunate.)

Neither of these problems are bad. Everyone's got times that they're more productive than others. For me, it's routinely late at night, but it can also be early in the morning, before my day starts (so, today, for example). It's also never bad to be able to block out other distractions and have a "I want to get \_\_\_\_\_\_ done" time. The only downfall is picking and choosing what sorts of things are important enough to fill that time with, and finding ways to make sure that you still get everything else done (for example, I'm not letting this stupid iCal notification go away about how I have class in 18 minutes).

**It's all a matter of playing "brain games" with yourself.** In my world, I have 2 options:

1) Learn how to flip that switch to get myself to be productive and focus. 2) Realize that there are set times where that switch will be flipped automatically, and learn how to best utilize that.

#1 hasn't worked so well for me over the years. The moods to be productive seriously just hit me out of nowhere, and I just have to roll with them. As such, I've started making lists of things that I want to get accomplished in my life... right now, I need to pack for the weekend, as well as make a general packing list so that I'm able to streamline my time this summer (when I'm working on the road every week). I keep blog ideas stored up, I know what it is I need to get done regarding homework, and I've got some nice articles that I want to read saved in [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) so I can get back to them when I have time.

**Some habits don't need changing. Pick your battles. Learn when you have to fight with yourself, and when you can just go with the flow.**

... I sound like my parents more and more every day. Lol.
