[![](http://rootsandrings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/rr10tuesday.jpg?w=125&h=125&h=125)](http://rootsandrings.wordpress.com/)**1.  What two cities should be moved closer together?** Wherever I'm living, and Chicago.  So right now, that makes Cedar Falls, IA and Chicago.  I have yet to get there, and I would really like to do so ASAP.

**2. What was the first plane ride you took?** Easy... I haven't flown in a plane yet.

**3. What continent would you most like to visit?** That's a tossup between Europe and Asia.  In Europe, I'd love to visit (or maybe live in?) England, as well as France, Germany, Spain... I'd just go everywhere.  In Asia, I'd hit up Japan, China, Thailand, and (maybe) India... I'd love to try all the food there.  Mmmmmm...

**4. What’s your favorite place to window-shop?** The Apple Store... Best Buy is a close 2nd.

**5. What’s the least fun you’ve ever had at a place specifically tailored for fun?** Hrm... that's an interesting question.  I think I'd have to say Disney World, the first time (my sophomore year of high school).  I had a group of friends that had been together since 6th grade, and I think the start of the wedges that drove us apart were placed during that trip.  Plus, I didn't sleep at all on the 30 hour bus ride down there... LAME!

**6.  You’re stuck on an island with plenty of food, a companion, and a relatively stress-free lifestyle. What do you say when the rescue ship comes?** I'd make some wisecrack about "Good, I didn't have to eat you..." and then "OMG INTERNET!!!  COME HERE!!!"

**7. Which day of the week do you look forward to most?** Fridays.  3 classes, and then I'm done.  No work, no nothing until Sunday.  Friday mornings are my signal for a good day.

**8. What’s your favorite place to enjoy the great outdoors?** More often than not, I'm enjoying the outdoors whenever I go out to play disc golf with my friends.  However, my favorite place that I've ever been and enjoyed nature was... well, it's a tossup between the Boundary Waters in northern Minnesota, or Glacier National Park in Montana.  Both were amazing.

**9. What’s on your “to do” list this summer?** Work.  Make lots of money.  Pay off my parents (finally).  Go on a vacation (Chicago?  Nashville?  St. Louis?  Kansas City?  Not sure yet...).  Get refreshed/recharged for the next school year.

**10. Which natural disaster freaks you out the most?** I'm fascinated by tornados, so not those.  Honestly, I'm really freaked out right now about the high percentage of earthquakes that seem to be happening near populated areas.  I know we haven't gotten any more than normal, it's just the frequency with which people are dying to them that weirds me out.
