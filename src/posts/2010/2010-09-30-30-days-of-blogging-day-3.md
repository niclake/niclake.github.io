Day 3: Something you have to forgive yourself for.

Oof, tough one.  There's not a lot of things that I haven't forgiven myself for.  I've spent boatloads of money I shouldn't have, wasted a whole bunch of time, done some dumb things, yadda yadda.  I think the one thing that I regret the most, and still kick myself for (even though there was really no other option), is **_giving up playing piano_.**

![](images/Piano.gif)For those that don't actually know me, or didn't know me when I was younger... I was the shit when it came to piano around here.  Seriously.  Started at age 4 1/2, which probably pleased my mother greatly (she's a piano teacher).  The family invested thousands of dollars on teachers, since my mom and I fought enough every morning when I'd practice (in high school, it was an hour and a half before school, and 2 hours on the weekends).  It worked, though, because it was like I had 2 different teachers over the same subject.  Took from a lady named Joan for a long time, and then (6th grade? 7th? Can't recall) I switched to taking lessons from a college professor at the nearby Wartburg College.

During this entire time, I dominated.  Yearly piano competitions in the region?  I won every time.  State?  Ended off winning twice.  Always helped close out the talent shows, from kindergarten up through 9th grade.  Nearly tried out to play a concerto for the local symphony orchestra.

Even with all of that, I hated it.  Call it youth rebellion or whatever.  Because my mom wanted me to do it, logically, I didn't want to.  My favorite days of the year were my birthday, holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving, and the days after competitions, when I knew I wouldn't have to practice.

Eventually, I'd pick up other instruments.  Drums in 5th grade, which was followed shortly thereafter by percussion in band (which I also rocked... 2 year All-Stater.  Would've been 3, but I just didn't give a crap my junior year), bass in 7th, and guitar in 8th/9th.  I wouldn't be anywhere in the same galaxy of as good of a musician as I am today if it wasn't for the piano training that I had, and I knew this... yet I still detested it.

Then two things happened nearly simultaneously that changed everything.  My mom went through a big health scare, which eventually led to her diagnosis of having MS (on top of arthritis and diabetes), and I developed tendonitis.

Both of us are still affected by our ailments to this day.  Watching my mom battle everything to still pursue the activities that she loves (piano teaching and cross-stitching) is quite inspiring.  For me, guitar is the only activity from my youth that I can do without discomfort.  Piano, bass, drums, sports are all out the window for anything more than a brief excursion.

I miss the piano.  I really do.  Maybe not the 12ish hours of practicing a week I put into it, but the instrument itself, I miss greatly.  I could've gone on to be a music performance major in college, probably gotten a full ride, and wouldn't have to worry about student loans or anything.  I probably wouldn't have a life either, since that 12ish hours of practicing would probably be accomplished in 3 days by some college students.  I've strongly considered talking to the head of the music department here about getting a key to the practice rooms again, just so I can see if I've got any chops left.  Haven't done it, just because I don't have the time to devote to it.

I don't know if forgiving myself is necessarily the right response in this case... but it still is the biggest regret that I have to this day.
