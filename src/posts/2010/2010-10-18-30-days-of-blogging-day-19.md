Day 19: (scenario) Your best friend is in a car accident and you two got into a fight an hour before. What do you do?

Fights are stupid.  I understand disagreements that people get in and so forth... but an actual fight?  99% of the time, that's just immaturity.  Or at least, I think so.

But if that was the case?  _**I'd go see him to make sure he was ok**_.  Also, I'd claim dibs on his stuff (kidding).  There's no reason a simple disagreement should get in the way of friendship.

(Off topic... oh my goodness, I'm starving right now...)
