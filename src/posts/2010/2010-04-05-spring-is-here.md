Yes, I have declared it so.  Spring has finally arrived.  A couple days of 70+ degree weather.  4 rounds of disc golf already in the books.

Oh, and this minor thing called Opening Day for Baseball.

For those that don't know, I am a HUGE sports fan.  My favorite sport?  Baseball.  It's truly perfect for my mentality.  Simple enough to get me (and others) hooked.  Complex enough to intrigue me at all levels.  Exciting enough that it makes me want to watch, but slow paced so I can get things done in between pitches/innings/pitcher changes.  And everything is based on statistics... the numbers never lie in baseball, and for some reason, I LOVE baseball statistics.

And my favorite team?  The Red Sox.

There's actually a story behind it too.  When I was about 12 or so, my dad and I went up to Minneapolis to a Twins game.  Now, my grandpa was a Twins fan, and my other grandparents were Cubs fans.  I could've taken up the family tradition and picked one of those teams as my favorite, and since the Twins game was going to be my first MLB game, my grandpa was just certain that I'd become a lifelong fan.

Sorry, Grandpa.

See, the Twins were hosting this team called the Boston Red Sox.  I didn't know it at the time, but the Sox were about as miserable as the Cubs when it came to bad luck.  They hadn't won a world series since 1918, right before they sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees.  It figures that I would pick a "loser" out of the bunch.  But they ended off beating the Twins that day, and so I decided to jump on the bandwagon.

I remember talking on the phone with my high school girlfriend while I'd watch the 2004 MLB playoffs, including Boston's miracle comeback against the Yankees in the AL Championship and their eventual World Series title.

I remember battling my depression, and how the Sox winning the 2007 World Series would actually be the catalyst to help me pull out of my funk.

I remember the start of last season, when we took the first 8 games that we played against the Yankees.

Goooooooood memories. :-)

I'm not one of those pig-headed sports fans that only watches my team and hates everyone else.  While I live and breathe the Red Sox year round, I've always been a big fan of the Braves.  I remember watching Glavine, Smoltz, and Maddux pitching when I was growing up, and as I wrote this paragraph, I just got done watching the Braves beat the stuffing out of the Cubs on opening day.

On the flip side, I'm also a Cubs fan.  You kinda have to pick the Cubs or the Cardinals if you live here in the midwest.  I'll watch the Cards, but the Cubs have grown near and dear to me, since I've kinda lived with the "losers" before already.  I give a lot of my diehard Cubs fans a lot of grief, but it's all in good fun, and I root for them just as hard as the next guy.

Really, the only team that I don't like in baseball is the Yankees.  They have a lot of great players, some great coaches, and are legends in the sports.  I have nothing but respect for the various individuals in the organization... but I hate the team.  I play fantasy baseball (which also helps me to love the sport as a whole, rather than just one team), and my one rule is: "Don't draft any Yankees."  And I haven't.  Ever.

I'm sorry, I know I'm boring a lot of you with my sports mumbo jumbo.  But you have to realize... sports is a way of life to a lot of people, male or female.  Northern Iowa finally lost in the NCAA tournament (WE BEAT KANSAS, SUCKERS!!!!!!!), and I instantly switched over to baseball mode.  Last night's Yanks/Sox opener was a fantastic way to start the season, and the games (or parts that I've caught) today have been outstanding.

Woo.

Went on a date last week... 2nd real date since "the breakup"... you know, the one that was 2.75 years ago.  I don't really foresee anything coming from it... it was mostly just getting coffee and hanging out a bit.  It just felt good to get out of my funk, you know?  There's someone that currently has my interest, but I'm not sure if I really want to pursue anything, considering that summer starts in 4 weeks and I'll be traveling all over the midwest this summer.

Bollux.

The home stretch for school has begun.  19 days of class, and then 4 days of finals, and summer begins.  I'm excited for many reasons... obviously a break from school, getting to work for a great job (that's gonna look amazing on my resume), making great money, (hopefully) paying my parents off completely for all the money they've lent me over the past 2 years, traveling, perhaps a baseball game at Wrigley... it should be pretty eventful and enjoyable.

Enjoy your spring, everyone.  Hopefully your weather is as wonderful as ours has turned into... well, minus this rain we have now. :-P
