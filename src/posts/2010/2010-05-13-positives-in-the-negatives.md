I'm sick of hearing people whine about mundane things.

That means you too.

![](images/yinYang.gif)This is part of the reason that I'm really glad that school is over and done with for a few months.  A lot of people that lived around me, as well as friends/acquaintances, loved to just piss and moan about their various problems.  Some were serious, some were minor, most were fixable, but it seemed no one was taking the actions to do anything.

I've always been the guy that people go to with things.  If you need to talk, if you need advice, that's what I do best.  (I've even gotten better as of late about the offering of unwarranted advice... go me.)  But really, there's only so much I can do.  And the only thing that bums me out more than not having good advice to give someone?

Giving them good, solid advice, and having them ignore it completely.  (And then, of course, wonder why they keep having the problem...)

I can go back to every major problem that I've ever had in my life, look over what's happened, and realize that there is ALWAYS something good that comes from a bad/crappy/whatever situation.  Well, at least so far.  It's that age-old saying "when one door shuts, another one opens".

\- I tore a tendon in my wrist freshman year of college, and had surgery on both that and my tendonitis-afflicted elbow.  Bad: got away from being a music ed. major, stopped playing drums.  Good: ended off finding what I love (MIS/computers), played more guitar.  Added bonus: went on a slight health/exercise kick, due to wanting to keep the arm strengthened.

\- Breaking up with "the ex".  Bad: it crushed me.  Not necessarily the breaking up part, but the "oh, I cheated on you" part.  That sucked, and took me FOREVER to get over.  Good: I wasn't ready to be married anyway.  I've learned how to NOT approach a relationship.  I've taken a 0 tolerance policy with cheaters.  I've not gotten drunk as much (she loooooved to party), nor participated in other devious/dangerous activities.  Added bonus: I've met people recently that know her/her current fiance (I wonder if she's cheated on him...), and so we get to swap stories about how stupid they are.  Doesn't accomplish anything, but it sure makes me feel good.

\- Dropping out of school for a year.  Bad: I'll graduate now when I'm 25.  All my friends are leaving.  I have only core classes left, plus 3 gen eds, for 2 full semesters (yuck).  Good: I'll graduate.  I'll make new friends.  I got out of computer science (which was "meh") and into management information systems (which is "much better than meh").  Added bonus: with fewer people/distractions around, that (hopefully) means that I'm able to focus more on my studies.

Did I/do I bitch and moan about all of the above at times?  Sure.  There's days (today) where the weather will bother my arm greatly, or I miss playing drums.  There's days where I really hate being single, and I'd still punch her in the face if I saw her.  (Well... maybe not.  But I'd like to think so.)  And there's days where I'm seriously bummed about everyone leaving before I will.  I'm sure this spring, when Curt goes off to do his student teaching, that I'll kinda go "um... where is everybody?!?"  But that all happens.

I'm not saying "you can't complain".  No no no.  I complain.  Everyone does it, and everyone has a right to.  But it's all a balancing act.  Yin and Yang.  Light and Dark.  Democrats and Shit-heads Republicans.  If all you've got is the one side, how can you ever expect your life to be balanced?  Fill that void with positives.  Sit back and go "what benefits did I get from this?"  Granted, sometimes it takes days/weeks/months/years for those benefits to present themselves.  But wallowing in self-pity, or ignoring solid advice from your friends and peers, just pisses everyone off.

Find those positives buried inside of those negatives.  Use a bad situation to your advantage.  Make the best out of what you've got.  Just don't tell me "there's nothing I can do"... not if you want me to take you seriously, anyway.
