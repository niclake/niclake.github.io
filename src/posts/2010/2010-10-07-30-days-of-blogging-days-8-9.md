Sorry I didn't get to this sooner... I had the idea in mind for yesterday's post, but I've been battling another illness (a cold this time), and have been sleeping a ton. So anyway... here I am. And here's your double dose.

Day 8: Someone who has made your life hell, or treated you like shit.

I'm not really sure if there's anyone that fits in this category. Obviously, [my previously-mentioned ex](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2010/10/01/30-days-of-blogging-day-4/) would qualify, but that would be cheating.

I was definitely an outcast in junior high. I had very few friends, and those friends all had other social groups that they could identify with. I managed to float between all of those groups fairly well, but there were a couple guys that seemed to enjoy making my life miserable. But hellish? Nah. It's part of growing up, and somewhere deep inside, I knew that.

You know what? Screw it. _**The ex**_ gets this category by default.

Day 9: Someone you didn't want to let go, but just drifted.

This one's easy. _**My best friend all through high school, Laura**_. To this day, I'm really not sure why we drifted. Probably just due to college/growing up. And I'm still kinda bummed about it. I'm obviously doing alright... not losing any sleep over it or anything... but every once in a while, I feel like I should reach out to her just to reconnect and see how she's doing. I've tried a couple times, but haven't yet been able to reconnect.

We actually shared a class during my first semester after the massive breakup, but that was also the semester where the depression kicked in full force (I ended off completely flunking that semester, but was able to later get a medical withdrawal), and so we rarely saw each other. The last time I hung out with her was when we studied for our first Astronomy test.

Huh.

\----------

So I mentioned something about the direction of this site back when I started this project. Safe to say that those changes have been put into motion, and I'm excited about the direction that they're taking. I'm \*hoping\* that it'll be ready in 3 weeks. Not really sure though... depends on how many curveballs school throws my way. I'm really excited, though. :-)
