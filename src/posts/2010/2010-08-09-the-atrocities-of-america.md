By finishing tied for 78th (out of 80) at the WGC-Bridgestone, Tiger Woods still earned more than the average teacher salary in 44 states.

2 of the most important profession fields are medical and educational. Doctors make more money than I'll probably ever see in my life. My internship pays me more money than a lot of primary education teachers make.

Our government, while being a democracy, has its flaws. The average age of Congress at the start of the most recent session was 56. That's the average. And we're letting people that are on their way out make decisions about the life and laws that the people on their way in are going to have to live by. Or what about the amount of money that they spend on themselves, from giving themselves raises to [the tons of money they spend on food and catering](http://www.pdviz.com/how-congress-spends-billions-on-itself)?

The biggest story in the news over the past few months could've been solved if BP would've been willing to pony up the half million dollars for a simple "off" switch on their pipes. You know, like what the rest of the world does.

I can call the police to report a theft, report the incident to my bosses, check out the other cars that had things stolen, order Chinese delivery, call a pawn shop, and have the food arrive before the cop does.

As a country, we are so health and image conscious. Promoting healthy eating habits, having programs to help those with bulimia/anorexia, and having 24 hour fitness centers sprouting up everywhere. Yet at the same time, we're cool with McDonalds, Chipotles, Burger King, Starbucks, and any other number of fast food adding restaurants all over our cities... and we keep going there. "Whew, I just went out and ran a mile... now I need my Big Mac!" You can also get frozen dinners and pizzas for dirt cheap, but buying food necessary for healthy meals? The potential to spend a lot of money is huge.

From an early age, we teach our kids that the best way to pass the time is to sit in front of the TV and watch random crap or play video games, instead of reading a book, going outside and getting exercise, or spending time with friends.

The legal system in America has a soft spot for celebrities. If an average citizen gets arrested for murdering someone, they go to prison for a long long time. If a celebrity gets arrested? They get some crazy lawyer to clog the legal system for an extended period of time, and either get off completely free and clear, or get a slap on the wrist. Same with drugs, rape, drunk driving, etc. etc.

This is just what I could think of before I went to bed. Feel free to add your own in the comments.
