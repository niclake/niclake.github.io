**[![](http://rootsandrings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/rr10tuesday.jpg?w=125&h=125&h=125)](http://rootsandrings.wordpress.com/)1. If you were given an hour to use a $200 Amazon gift card, what would you buy?** Good question... Amazon's got all kinds of stuff.  I'm sure I could go nuts on the DVDs and music stuff.

**2. Are there any fairly common foods that you’ve never had?** Pickles.  I can't stand the smell.

**3. What was your favorite way to use your imagination as a kid?** I made up a lot of stuff in my head, and still do to this day (though nowadays things are much more structured... usually).  This is probably part of the reason why school and I don't get along much.  I tried drawing, but failed at it.  I didn't discover musical expression until I was in high school.  The best answer is probably Legos.  I built some craaaaaaaaazy stuff with Legos as a kid, let me tell you.

**4. What’s your favorite state? Why?** Massachusetts.  Specifically, the city of Boston.  I'm a huge Red Sox fan, and for whatever reason, I think it would just be the best thing ever if I uprooted right now and moved out there.  If it's a state that I've actually been to... then probably Texas.  Love the food, love the atmosphere, love the warmth (it's 14 degrees here, which is a heat wave compared to the negative temps we've had the past few months)... yeah, I could go to Austin and be just fine. :-)

**5. If it was our culture to have our parents choose our spouses, do you think yours would make a good choice?** I have a feeling I know who my mom would've chosen, and looking at it now, I would've been just fine with that. :-P  No clue who my dad would've picked for me.

**6. What’s your favorite herb?** I loooooooooooooooooove oregano.  Love it.  Love love love love.  Om nom nom!!!

**7. If you could have dinner with one celebrity, who would you choose?** Is this dinner?  Dinner and a movie?  Dinner/movie/my place for drinks?  If it's the latter, Jessica Alba (you guys know what I'm talking about).  For just dinner though... President Obama.  He's a celebrity now, right?  That man oozes charisma, loves his sports, and seems to have a very level head on his shoulders.  He'd probably be a great guy to bounce ideas off of, no matter what the subject.  If I have to go true celebrity (which, in my world, includes athletes), I would choose Peyton Manning.

**8. What’s your favorite Disney movie?** Pixar counts?  Good.  Monsters, Inc.  Hilarious (including the "For the Birds" short).

**9. If you had to listen to the same song over and over for 24 hours, what song would you choose?** 1812 Overture, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra (this has the added advantage of being a long song, so I hear it fewer times :-P )

**10. How do you order your steak?** Medium rare.  That's how you cook a steak, ladies and gents.  If I ever cook at a restaurant and you order anything above medium, I will literally shape burger into a steak shape and burn it for you.  Also, no steak sauce.  If you wanna add onions or something to the top, that's fine.  Ugh, people that ruin a good steak bother me.  Pet peeve #1,598,294.
