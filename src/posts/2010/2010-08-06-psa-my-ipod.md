We interrupt your routine Friday with this public service announcement...

Do you see this iPod?

Well?  Do you?  Do you see it?

This is an iPod.  A 160gb iPod Classic, to be precise.  MY iPod.  My NEW iPod.

I thought, hey, since my iPod got stolen on Monday, maybe I should go get a new one.  I mean, seriously, what's the likelihood of me ever getting that old one back?  Probably slim to none.  Plus, today is tax free weekend, so added bonus!  (Apparently, iPods are not eligible for this tax break, but I digress.)

So now, I have it.  A brand new, bigger iPod.

See, I've worked hard to make money this summer, and I've spent that hard earned money to replace something that shouldn't have to be replaced.  (Well, actually, it's my early Christmas present from Grandma... don't judge me.)  And if someone steals this one?  There will be hell to pay.  I will find you, and I will end you.  **_END_** you.  Got it?  Good.

(Oh, and I got a hair cut.  Thank God.)

We now return you to your regularly scheduled Friday.
