![](images/IMG_6307-copy-790545.jpg)For my job, we drive. A lot. I've put in at least 4,000 miles so far this summer in the company car, and it'll probably be close to 6,000 by the time I'm done in 3 weeks. It's extremely rare for me to be driving west at night, but lo and behold, I found myself doing that the other night.

Let me set the stage for you... open Missouri plains/prairie/farmland/whatever. Fairly empty highways. A Kia Spectra. Me, with no sunglasses. A long day, and an early morning up ahead. A 2 hour drive to the next town. A hotel bed waiting for me. A sunset in front of my face. A northward turn about 20 miles in front of me.

You guessed it... I was speeding.

As I drove along, squinting my eyes in a futile attempt to find the center line, I was thinking... I wonder if it would be possible to fly faster than the sunset. My dad and I had talked a while back about him taking a fighter jet ride in Europe back when he was in the military, and how fast he was going. I was putting 2 and 2 together, imagining I was a fighter jet. It was pretty awesome.

Unfortunately, imaginary fighter jets are not immune to real police cars.

Long story short, I got my 2nd speeding ticket in 5 weeks (my first out-of-state ticket!!!), and I'm on an extremely short leash until mid-June 2011. One more ticket, and I get my license yanked. I'm super excited, let me tell you.

I just looked it up... [Mach 1 is about 760 mph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number). The earth rotates at somewhere between [700-900 mph here in the Midwest](http://ask.yahoo.com/20020411.html). A commercial jet [has made it to Mach 2.35](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft). So, yes, it's completely possible. :-P

In completely unrelated news... it looks like I'm going all Apple here soon. I'm selling my HP laptop (portable beast, as I call it) to a friend, then buying another friend's MacBook Pro. When the internship is over, I should hopefully have enough money for an iPad. And in November when my contract is up, I'm switching over to AT&T (yeah, I know...) and getting an iPhone. Add to that my iMac and my old PowerBook... wee. :-D (I'm actually the most excited about the iPhone, if nothing else, because [Nico has been posting some fun vlogs](nicopolitan.com/) \[video blogs\] over at his site, and I wanna do some myself.)
