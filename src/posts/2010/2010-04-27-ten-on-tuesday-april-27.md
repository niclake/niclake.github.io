[![](images/200906_zack-morris-phone.jpg)**Zack Morris’s phone**](http://rootsandrings.wordpress.com/)**?** Definitely don't have to go back a decade.  Got my first phone when I got into college.  It was a TracFone flip phone, the same as my girlfriend's.  That thing was a piece...

**2. What is the first children’s book you remember being read to you?** Something by Dr. Seuss.  Probably "Oh The Places You'll Go" or "Green Eggs and Ham".  I do not like ham, Sam I Am...

**3. What was your first car? Did you love it or hate it?** 1988 Buick Regal.  I purchased it from my friend's family - his sister drove it all through high school and her first years in college.  Coolest part about the car: The handles were up on the sides of the doors, rather than where they normally are.   Always entertaining to watch people try and get in.

**4. Who was your hero growing up?** Not really sure if I ever had a hero, per se.  I looked up to my teachers, my parents, people at church... but I never really had a hero.

**5. Think back to your first kiss. Was it everything you dreamed of?** Completely unexpected and kinda awesome.  Brings back some "meh" memories now (it was with the ex who I now despise, back in high school...), but it was still good.

**6.  What was your first BAD hairstyle choice? (Extra points for embarrassing photos)** Before 4th grade, I thought it would be cool to have long hair.  Long hair became a mullet, and it is immortalized on my parent's "Wall of Fame".  Vunderbar...

**7. What was your first realistic dream? (One where you had to think “Oh dang, was that a dream?”)** I had a dream once that I was falling.  It was  kinda pleasant, not really scary or anything.  Next thing I know, there's a loud "THUMP", and I wake up and realize that I'm on the floor.  I had a bunk bed for many years (for some reason), but I always slept on the bottom bunk.  This night, I'd slept on the top bunk, and had rolled off.  Somehow, I'd managed to bring a pillow and a blanket with me when I fell, so apparently I had fallen back asleep before my parents got to my room to figure out what was up.  I was probably 6 or 7 at the time... maybe younger.

**8. What was the first phobia you remember developing?** Heat.  When we went camping for Boy Scouts once, someone apparently started a fire in a pit that had an opened pineapple can in it.  They later removed this can with a stick, but I didn't know about this.  I'd been given matches for the first time, and thought to myself "what would happen if I dropped a couple matches into the can, then lit one and dropped that in as well?"  Went to pick up the can... burned the palm of my hand/all of my fingers/thumb.  ER visit and all that.  Still extremely cautious around heat, which makes cooking difficult.

**9. Which character on Sesame Street do you most identify with?** Depends.  If I'm talking money/grades with my parents, Oscar the Grouch.  If I'm hungry, Cookie Monster.  If I'm hyper, Elmo.

**10. What was the hardest goal you ever accomplished?** Well, I'm in the process of getting my degree... 2 more years of this, and then my goal will be accomplished.  I guess my hardest one thus far would be getting the courage to ask for help so I could go back to school.  Thankfully, my parents and my grandpa were willing to help me out.
