[![](http://rootsandrings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/rr10tuesday.jpg?w=125&h=125&h=125)](http://rootsandrings.wordpress.com/)**1. When you were a senior in high school, what career did you think you’d choose? Did you? Why or why not?** I was nearly certain that I was going to be a percussion/band instructor for the rest of my life. And I pursued it here at the university. However, I quickly discovered that my passion for music is more internal than external, and that it would be very difficult for me to teach others how to do the things that I love. Also, I'd dealt with tendonitis in my arm for years, and finally had a tendon in my wrist snap that April, requiring surgery and me to effectively retire from percussion.

**2. What one thing about the “real world” did you find most surprising once you were on your own?** Mom and Dad were right. Funny that I'd deem that "surprising", but time after time, I kept running into situations where I knew they wanted to say "told you so" but didn't. Oh well... that's part of growing up, right?

**3. Name 3 things you think your closest friends DON’T like about you.** I can be flakey about doing things (i.e. not going to play disc golf because I'm tired), I'm stubborn, and I can be a bit of an annoyance/pest at times.

**4. In order to sleep, do you need background noise or absolute quiet?** I usually have my iTunes playing quietly when I go to bed. Sleeping without music playing is quite difficult for me. I'll listen to anything from quiet Mozart or Sigur Ros all the way up to Metallica or death metal/hardcore. It makes no difference, it'll still help me relax.

**5. Why do you choose to reside in your current city? Yes, you have a choice ![:-)](images/icon_smile.gif)** I still live where I do because I'm going to college. Part of it is the familiarity and proximity to home, part of it was (initially) because UNI has one of the best music education programs in the nation (which then translated into one of the best Computer Science programs, and now into one of the best undergrad Business programs). Also, because I'm broke.

**6. Are you close to your parents?** Relatively. I don't divulge every little thing, but they're pretty much in-the-know with most of my life, and I wouldn't have made it as far as I have without them.

**7. What is your favorite fiction book? Poem? Blog?** Huge fan of the Ender's Game series. I think I'm going to have to find those books and re-read them... they managed to disappear out of my bookshelf at home, and I'm not really sure where they went. Poems... well, I equate poetry to music usually, but I can't say that I have a favorite poem itself. And blog? Tough... I'm pretty partial to my own. ;-)

**8. Do you enjoy cooking or is it a chore?** I love it. I had the opportunity to really be self-sufficient last year when I lived in an apartment. While there are times where it's just easier to throw in a pizza or something, I love the reward of a well-cooked meal. Even if it's simple stuff. And it usually makes great leftovers too.

**9. Be honest. What one thing would (the majority of) your blog readers be shocked to find out about you?** I deal with depression every day of my life. I battled it and successfully conquered it in 2008, but it still creeps back and tries to bite me in the ass. Sometimes it's those "dark/blue days". Sometimes it's just being tired or unmotivated to do things. Referencing question 3 above, that's why I don't go and do things or get stubborn about things. I hide it pretty well from most people because it's not their battle, and nothing that they say or do can really help me. Though when I do need help, I'm very thankful for those around me that are able to give me words of encouragement or the ass-kicking that I need to get into gear.

Ask me about it if you're curious.

**10. If you were given your own national holiday, what would you require people to eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner on the Day of You? Would there be a parade? Greeting cards?** First, no greeting cards. I hate those things. Second, it would be on my birthday, Feb. 13. I would require that everyone take a space heater outside and melt as much snow as possible. Unless you live where it's warm. Then just go outside and enjoy the day.

For food... eggs/pancakes/wheat toast + butter/your choice of sausage or bacon for breakfast, a good cold meat sandwich for lunch, and then homemade spaghetti for dinner. Unless you have friends/family that want to take you out for food. Then by all means, go and celebrate that way.

That's kinda lame, isn't it? Yeah... oh well.
