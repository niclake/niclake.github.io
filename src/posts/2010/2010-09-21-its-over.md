The hiatus, that is.

After nearly a month since my last blog post (actually a little longer, I guess), I'm back.  Did you miss me?

... say yes, damnit.  You'll hurt my feelings.

School is so so.  Met some pretty cool people, enjoying time with some of the other residents on my floor.  It's nice actually having people that are social this year... compared to last year, it's about 500x better.  Classes are alright.  One of them is a complete waste of time, and I hate accounting (thank God this is the 2nd of 2 classes I need), but the other 3 are good/fun/enjoyable.  Not easy, but enjoyable.

I miss blogging/writing, though... but I've been in a funk lately.  Just nothing really to write about (or at least, not stuff that I want to share...).  It looks like some of the VEDA people are going to start doing videos again, and I'm more than likely going to participate.  Whether I post them on my blog, or just onto my YouTube channel remains to be seen.  I'll let you know, though.

The new guitar amp kicks ass... but now I want to finish my pedal board.  Problem is, that's gonna run me a few hundred dollars, which I don't have.  I'm also still without a Telecaster, which makes me sad.  Soon enough... (in case you've never noticed, patience isn't one of my strong suits.)

It's also Tuesday, which means it's Question Tuesday.  I haven't participated in a while, I thought maybe I would this time.

**1. What’s the one thing you always do when you’re stressed?** Vent.  Somehow.  Whether I have a beer, talk with a friend, play guitar, blow up things in some video game, work out, or whatever.  If I don't vent, that's when I start getting depressed, and I don't like that.  At all.

**2. What’s the weirdest thing you’ve ever done for a friend?** A friend of my cousin needed a ticket to some concert, and so I was persuaded to go to the venue early (since I live here in town) and get her a ticket, then wait for her to show up and give it to her.  All I knew was that "she's pretty" (which was true) and "she'll be there around <this time>" (they were late).  Kinda odd, but it worked out alright.

**3. What cleaning supply could you not live without?** Cleaning?  Who does that?!?  If it's dirty, I clean it up with whatever's on hand.  If it can't be cleaned, I put duct tape over it.  Problem solved.

**4. How long do you plan on living where you currently reside?** During the remainder of this school year, plus next school year (I'm in the dorms).

**5. Do you usually vote straight party, a mixture, or not at all?** I classify myself as a liberal-leaning independent.  I registered as a Democrat so I could caucus for Obama, then immediately switched my party affiliation back to independent.  I will vote for whoever I feel is best for the job, regardless of party affiliation.  If I don't like any of the candidates (or don't know them), I won't vote.

**6. What’s something that you love to do, but seem to never make time for?** Music.  It seems to be an afterthought to me to play and/or listen to music nowadays.  And I really, REALLY don't like that.  Maybe I'll do something about that as soon as I'm done blogging... (Oh, blogging is another of those things.)

**7. What’s your favorite store to buy things for other people?** I routinely only buy things for my parents... thus, Amazon for my dad (books/music) and a place called Twin Oaks for my mom (frames for her cross stitching works... she has a lot, and she's really good).

**8. What’s the weather like around you today**? I'm certain that Mother Nature is going through a bout of PMS right now.  Sunday, it was about 50 degrees.  Monday, it was 80.  Today, it's currently 65 and raining.  Seriously, Iowa, make up your mind.

**9. What’s the worst book you’ve ever bought and read?** On Liberty by John Stuart Mill.  Had to buy/read it for my Philosophy class.  It was seriously the most pointless 3-4 weeks of my life.  I hated that book (and that professor) so much.

**10. What’s the closest thing to you that is yellow?** This...

My Hawkeyes can koozie.  Which, I'm wondering why it's on my desk... since I haven't drank any canned/bottled liquids in a while.  (Oh yeah, Bryce moved it...)
