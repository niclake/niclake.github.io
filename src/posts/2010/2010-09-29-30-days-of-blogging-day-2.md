Day 2: Something you love about yourself.

Today's topic is almost as difficult to nail down as yesterday's was.  Again, lots of good topic ideas, but I think I'm going to jump off the beaten path and go with something slightly more... creative.  **_I am an extremely passionate person_.**

**If I get even a slight interest in something, I'm all in, 100%.  I got hooked on photography back in high school.  Any instrument that I've ever played, at some point, I've committed a lot of time and energy to.  Don't ever try and talk me out of being an Apple guy (as I type this on my HP laptop... yuck).  I'm a die-hard Red Sox fan, more than likely for life (of course, I like watching other teams play, but Red Sox trump all).  I'm hoping that this blogging project gets the same treatment... right now, I'm working on being 2 for 2.**

**It's the same way with me and relationships.  I'm not a half-assed kinda guy, especially when it involves another person.  It's part of the reason I don't see much point in "casual dating".  Casual dating right now seems to be synonymous with "someone you take to coffee, maybe a movie, and then back to the bedroom, then don't talk to them for a few days/weeks".**

**Whoop-de-flurkin'-do.**

**Being an all-or-nothing type person can definitely get me into trouble.  Combined with my impulsiveness, it can actually lead to some pretty catastrophic results, but I've thankfully been able to keep the two of them separate for a vast majority of the time.**

**My problem is persistence and perseverance.  Sometimes, I lack that.  I'll be all gung-ho about something, and then one of my many other interests will pull my attention, and the first topic will get shoved into a corner for a few months.  Photography is one of the biggest losers in this regard.  Which is unfortunate, because I REALLY like photography.**

**I've always thought that maybe I need to cut back on some of my interests, and this is why.**
