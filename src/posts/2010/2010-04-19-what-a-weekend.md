This was exactly what I needed.

Friday morning, I woke up, checked my e-mail and blogs and such, and then pulled all the power in my room.  Went to my 3 classes, and then hopped in a car with Bryce and Zeke for a weekend trip up to Minneapolis.  Parked at Mall of America, hopped on the metro, and rode across town to the brand new Target Field.

Oh.  My.  Goodness.

My live baseball game experience is slightly limited... I've been to the local college stadium (meh...) and to the Metrodome (for baseball, meh... football, hell yeah) on numerous occasions.  I'd been excited to see Target Field since I heard about it being built, and at 5 days old it was probably as immaculate as you could ever imagine.  A little chaotic, since the vast majority of people had no clue exactly where they were going, but all in all it wasn't too bad.  We grabbed a program, a beer (my first ballpark beer... $7?  Holy crap!), and headed for our seats out along the 3rd base line.

We actually walked around the stadium after it was all said and done, and realized that there's absolutely no bad seat in the house.  Even the view from the outfield bleachers is still amazing.  Our seats were no exception... while we couldn't watch the pitch going in very well (it's way different from watching on TV), we could see every play being made during the course of the game.  We had some great people sitting around us, including a nice lady who knew her baseball, and a pair of mid-20's drunk guys right in front of us (one of whom passed out around the 5th inning... what a waste of a ticket).

The game was great.  Zeke is a Twins fan, so it was perfect for him (they won 10-3).  Bryce, on the other hand, is a Royals fan, so it was a little tougher for him to bear.  Myself?  I'm a die-hard Red Sox fan, and they'd just left the night before after getting pounded 8-0 by the Twins.  I took a little bit of flak, but all in all, everyone was extremely friendly and we had a great time.

I've actually discovered that keeping score at a baseball game is quite enjoyable.  It keeps you involved and helps you pay attention, allows you to fill in your friends/neighbors on what happened while they were in line for food or the bathroom, and gives me a great way to remember the game.  I'm actually thinking that I'm going to make a book of my own scorecards, and take it with me when I go to all my other baseball games.  Maybe I'll even score from home, who knows.

That night, we hit up a Perkins for some pie/late breakfast.  This is also the location at which we came up with [the list that's on my last blog post](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2010/04/17/595/).  Enjoy. :-P

Saturday, we hit up Mall of America.  Bryce, being a Missouri boy, had never been to the MoA, so we had to introduce him to the wonders that the mall offers.  It was funny, watching him walk around with his camera, taking pictures of everything like a tourist.  We found a couple great stores, including Field of Dreams, a store filled with sports memorabilia.  I'm sad I didn't have $300 to shell out on a couple signs and banners, but it's probably for the best.  Lots of walking (we made it around the entire mall, all 3 floors), lots of fun, and we finished it off with a round of mini golf (I lost).  We also managed to catch a little bit of the UNI Women's Rugby match vs. Stanford (Bryce's lady friend, and another friend of mine, are both on the team).  That night, Zeke's mom took us to a local performance of Jesus Christ Superstar... it was pretty interesting.

Let me see, what did I eat this weekend...

- McDonald's Chicken Nuggets
- Bud Light and Chili Dog @ Target Field
- Sausage biscuit platter @ Perkins
- French toast and sausage from Zeke's mom
- Caribou Coffee mocha
- Some spicy beef dish @ Panda Express
- Some other spicy chicken dish @ another Chinese restaurant in Minneapolis
- Egg puff and fresh strawberries from Zeke's mom
- Chicken burrito @ Chipotles in Rochester (no lie, I like Pablos and Pancheros a lot better)

Didn't make it to one of the Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives-featured restaurants, but that's ok.  I'll have plenty of time to accomplish that.

This was just a perfect weekend.  Tons of fun, new experiences, a great game, and a break from life/school at the absolute perfect time.  It was the recharge that I needed... not to mention that the queen sized bed I got to sleep on was SOOOOOOOOOOO COMFORTABLE!!!!  Haven't slept that soundly in months.

The 3 of us have made tentative plans to attempt to make it to every MLB stadium within the next 15 years.  We figure going to 2 games a year would be the way to do it.  We've got Chicago, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Milwaukee, and (sorta) Cleveland within a pretty reasonable distance (and have places to stay at for a couple of those), so we're hoping to go to a few of those in the next 2 years while we're in college.  We figure after we graduate/make money, we can afford Yankee Stadium, Fenway, LA, and the other more distant stadiums.

Now we've got 3 weeks of school to go... 2 weeks and then finals.  14 class days.  I can do this.  Bring it on.
