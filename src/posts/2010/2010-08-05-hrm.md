1. If someone ever invents a way to add about 4 hours to your day without losing any sleep, hook me up. I would purchase that instantly.
2. I'm a terrible blogger. For multiple reasons. I'm really terrible about staying current with my posts... hopefully I manage to keep up with this a little better.
3. I'm also really bad about commenting on other's blogs. Sometimes I just don't know what to say. Other times I don't have time to even make a comment. And still other times, I just don't have time to even read the posts. :-\\
4. Holy Samson, Batman... I need a haircut. Otherwise, we may see the return of the mullet... and I don't think anyone wants to see that.
5. Volunteering to work on Fridays, while giving me brownie points and more money, severely cuts into the downtime that I desperately need with this job...
6. I drafted a pretty scathing e-mail to the President of my university last year, talking about how crappy our internet on campus is. (Seriously, it's horrible.) Combined with the facts that no one in the IT department there seems to give a rat's ass, and that they're trying to actually add more and more people on campus every year, plus the evolving internet (YouTube, gaming, Grooveshark/Pandora, etc.) have made connection speeds take an absolute nosedive. I deleted the e-mail, because I realized that no one would care. However, I think I'm going to re-write that letter as soon as I get back on campus and submit it, at least to make myself feel better.
7. In just about 2 weeks, I will have a brand new guitar amp (a Vox AC30C2). I'm stoked for this.
8. I'm trying to sell my 3 laptops. 2 HP workhorses, and my PowerBook G4. If nothing else, it will go to help me finance either a new MacBook Pro, or an iPad (depending on how many I actually sell). If you're in the market for a laptop, let me know... this HP one I'm working on is awesome, and the other 2 aren't bad at all.
9. I'm extremely stoked for school to start up. 2 weeks from today until I move back into the dorms. Not gonna be a huge fan of the slow internet or the fact that they've switched cable over to Mediacom (seriously? What a crock), but you do the best with what you've got, right?
10. In tandem with school comes P90X. I'm getting in shape, getting rid of this flabby belly, and lookin' good for the ladies. .... well, that's the plan at least. Mostly, I'm just looking forward to putting my mind to a goal like this, and (hopefully) accomplishing it. It'll be perfect timing too... I'll finish the 90 days right before the week of Thanksgiving break, which gives me opportunity to enjoy some wonderful food.
11. The only downside with losing weight? I get colder easier. Stupid air conditioning...
12. I'm not nearly as much of a nerd/geek as I used to be. Yeah, I still play WoW, but it doesn't consume my soul like it used to. My PS3 has been boxed up since spring break. Part of me misses that side. Most of me doesn't.
13. I hit up the casino here in Sioux City last night. I've determined that me going to the casino without some friends that are also playing Blackjack with me is probably not the best decision. Thankfully, I only lost $15... but I played like shit. Lots of stupid decisions, combined with a lot of dealers making 21 on the 3rd card really started to tick me off. So much for making enough money to buy a new iPod.
14. Speaking of iPods... I'm really missing it these past two days. I've been sitting behind a desk in these Sioux City Hy-Vee accounting offices installing all of the updates on the servers, and I've desperately wanted to get away from the awful 90s pop that's been playing through the store speakers. It makes me cringe. I hear "Closing Time" playing right now... it's 1:15pm. It's \*not\* closing time. I kinda wish it was...
15. I just managed to nuke a server here at work.  So now I'm waiting for admins to see if we can fix it.  Fingers crossed...
