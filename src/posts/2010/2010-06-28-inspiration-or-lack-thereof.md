I haven't written a lot of blog posts lately. Sorry for that, all 2 dozen of you readers.

A big part of it has to do with the job (which is going great, by the way). When I'm on the road, there just isn't a lot of time to do much writing, nor even much thinking, since I'm being constantly bombarded with various problems that I need to fix. When I actually do have down time, that's usually the point where I kick my feet up and relax/fall asleep.

The other major part of why I've not been writing lately has been due to my lack of inspiration. Sometimes, I just don't feel like I have anything to write about... or if I do, I just don't feel like sitting still for a long enough period of time to actually do something about it. Mostly the former, though... I love writing.

Most of my blog posts over time have come to fruition because of something that someone will say or do, and it will spark a thought process in my head that won't quit until I actually write something about it. Great, fine, not like I'm gonna complain about that, right? But what happens when there's nothing there? Obviously, the blog has gone stagnant as of late. So what do I do? Who do I turn to for ideas? Where do I look for my inspiration from?

I think (and am going to start practicing) that I (we) should not be looking elsewhere for our inspiration, whether it's another person, a painting, a song, whatever. Rather, we should be looking inward to ourselves for our own drive and desire.

Everyone's always going to be an inspiration for someone. Parents inspire their children. Coaches inspire their players. Teachers, their students. Leaders, their followers. Pastors, their congregation. Bosses, their employees. Bloggers, their readers. It's just the way things roll. And inspiration from these outside sources is a great thing. With it, it enables people to push themselves beyond what they might consider their normal limits to be and achieve greatness. You'll see great feats of athletic performance during crunch time. A boss' dream becomes a reality when their employees are motivated to achieve those goals. And so on and so forth.

But what about those leaders, those parents, those coaches, those teachers? Where are they supposed to find their inspiration from? They don't have anyone to look to, and as such, they can sometimes find themselves waiting for things to happen, waiting for someone else to give them that push they need.

And that just doesn't cut it.

To be a successful person in any sort of position of leadership, we have to be willing and able to go within ourselves and find our own inspiration and motivation. People that start to flame out from running their own business have to dig deep, and maybe re-discover the reasons they opened their own business in the first place. Presidents have to acquire the fortitude to make tough decisions, decisions that have ramifications over millions of people. Athletes have to dig deep for every ounce of energy they have, and be willing to put it all on the line to accomplish that one great feat.

External inspiration will only carry you so far. Are you like me, standing on the edge of the pool with everyone shouting encouragement at you? Or have you already dug deep into your soul and jumped in?
