I actually had someone ask me today, "What is disc golf?" I was instantly saddened... the fact that people don't know the about it is truly a travesty. I actually wrote a post on my sports blog about this time last year, and thought maybe I would just transfer it over here, to share the wonders with you all.

Feb. 27, 2009

So people ask me quite often, "What exactly is disc golf?" Today is your lucky day. I'm going to educate you on the wonders of this lively little sport.

Short definition: disc golf is where you throw these...

at these.

Really, it's that simple.

![img_6253](http://wordstoplayby.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/img_6253.jpg?w=300 "img_6253")Ok, slightly longer answer. Disc golf is a very relaxing sport, extremely similar to regular golf, but it's able to be performed in a relatively short amount of time. At our local beginner course, a full round of 18 holes can be played in just under an hour if you want to... usually we idle about for approximately an hour and a half or so. It's played with specialized discs (you can use regular frisbees, but you'll find that the special discs have a lot better flight characteristics) that you can purchase at your local Wal-Mart, Scheels, or similar store. There are 3 main kinds of discs: drivers, mid-range, and putt/approach discs (told you it was similar to golf).

![img_6448](http://wordstoplayby.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/img_6448.jpg?w=225 "img_6448")You tee off from the tee box (sometimes a framed off patch of dirt, sometimes a concrete slab), throwing towards the hole. There are two primary ways of throwing, back hand (how most people throw a frisbee) and forehand. However, as you can see on the right, there are also ways of throwing the disc overhand for a different type of approach.

Didn't make it in? That's cool. Stand right behind your disc on the ground, and throw again. When you reach the basket, all you do is take your putter, aim for the chains, and throw it. Hopefully, the disc hits the chains firmly and drops into the basket.

Really. That's it. It's that easy.

Personally, I love disc golf. More often than not, my friends will get a 6 pack of beer, we'll drive out to the local course, and partake in about 2 hours of relaxation, off-color jokes, and (in their case... I don't like beer \[though this has actually changed since I wrote this post\]) a little alcohol on a lovely afternoon. Living in a college town, we often find many people taking a break from their studies (or occasionally their classes), but we've run across people of all ages and professions that play disc. The local course is pretty close to the local high school, so people would often take off during their release periods to try and fit in 9 or 18 holes before returning for AP Psychology, or whatever they had during 7th period.

However, here at the tail end of February, we've felt a little letdown. We had a massive flood here last spring (you may have seen how eastern Iowa got a wonderful amount of water in our backyards last year \[2008\]), and sadly one of the casualties of that was our disc golf course. Our lovely bench on the 9th hole is now probably floating in the Gulf of Mexico by now, but other than that, all the baskets and tees are still in place. While it didn't stop some of the regulars from checking the course out (that hill behind him? Underwater when it was all said and done), playing was nothing short of impossible.

Then, the same crazy dude decided to leave to go overseas to study abroad for the fall semester. The rest of us just felt... empty inside, and didn't really feel like partaking without him (don't cry, Jordan. This isn't a touching moment telling you how we really feel.), so we only played about 3 or 4 rounds the entire semester, as opposed to the 1-3 that we usually play per week.

All that backstory, just to share more pictures with you...

Middle of February. Nothing going on. We actually have had a few decent days outside, sometimes reaching the 40s (again, this is Iowa). We decided to cross our fingers and hope that this particular day was more of that "great weather".

It wasn't.

Like I said, I love this sport. A lovely combination of golf's rules and football's weather (seriously... let's turn on the sprinklers in San Diego next season. Hilarious). Yes, I got cold. Yes, my feet got soaked (you see how the ground gets darker between Doug and the basket? Yep, that's ice. It wasn't very thick). No, I don't drink their beer. But did I enjoy it? Absolutely.

I strongly encourage you... if you're young, have young, or are still young at heart, do a search for a disc golf course, take a frisbee, and go have a good time. You can meander all over the place without worries of a golf pro yelling at you to stop frolicking in the bunkers. Some of the people you'll see on the course may not necessarily look the friendlies character (charming smiles from the younger generation really just means we want food), but the overall etiquette on the course is universally pretty good.

If you're just starting, all you really need is one disc. A good driver, or even a mid-range disc is truly all you need. However, different discs have different characteristics, like speed (how fast/how far it will go), high speed turn (if it turns at all while traveling at high speeds, and how much), low speed turn (how much it turns at low speeds) and glide (how easy it is to keep it in the air). Often times my playing partners only bring 3 or 4 discs with them, while I bring all 10 of mine in my bag, just in case. Discs can run from $8 to $20, sometimes more (depending on the quality of the disc).

If you'd like some more information on disc golf, would like to research where to find a course or what disc to buy, I encourage you to check out [http://www.innovadiscs.com](http://www.innovadiscs.com/). Innova is the leader in discs and baskets, and their site has a lot of great information for anyone from beginner to advanced.

![img_6659](http://wordstoplayby.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/img_6659.jpg?w=300 "img_6659")It really sucks transferring this post over, because I've been craving some disc golf lately.  It got really cold really fast here in Iowa this winter, so our "play time" was cut woefully short.  My discs are sitting in my bag in my closet, just waiting for the opportunity to get out and soar through the air.  And now that I drink beer, I can actually partake in the full tradition that we like to celebrate.

I actually got my first hole-in-one this past fall, which netted me a nice little prize from everyone along with us (we have a rule that each person buys the person a 6-pack, but since I didn't like beer, they chipped in and got me a 750ml of Southern Comfort).  That was one of the final times I actually went out that season, which is probably contributing to why I want to get back out there so badly.

If you're around the Northern Iowa area and want to know what these "disc golf shenanigans" are all about, just let me know... we'll be happy to bring you along. :-)
