I'd like to think that my parents raised me pretty well, and that I've managed to adhere to their teachings as best as I've been able to. Everyone's got their moments, of course, but I actively attempt to keep these to a minimum. Obviously, when we get around our friends and family, we have the ability to become different people, and act in such a way that we may not otherwise, but even then most of the behavior is acceptable. However, now that I'm on the road more and more (yay, massive amounts of overtime!), I've been noticing a lot more unsavory actions occurring. These aren't stemming from me (though I'm sure I'm at fault sometimes), but rather from people in these various cities that I visit.

The thing that kinda pushed me into writing this post? Well...

We were at a Hy-Vee in Cedar Rapids about 2 weeks ago, working on getting their servers up and running, when I decided to make a jaunt to the restroom. As I entered, I witnessed an employee leaving the stall, tying his apron around his waist, and walking out the door (nope, he didn't wash his hands). All the other stalls were occupied, so I stepped in. What do I see?

Honestly, whatever amount he urinated \*INTO\* the toilet, I'm guessing that he matched that same amount that was either on the seat, or the floor around it.

Seriously, man, what the hell? A) I'm guessing you were either late in your high school career, or early in college. Your aim shouldn't need practice. B) If you do happen to miss a bit, clean it up. That's just the nice thing to do. C) Wash your damn hands, ESPECIALLY if you're an employee! (For the record, I found him working in the meat department not even 5 minutes later, handing/slicing meat with his bare hands. I gagged a bit.)

No one's perfect. I've got plenty of faults. But I hope that if they're big/disgusting/stupid/douche-y, that people would point them out so I can correct them.

Oh, and that guy? I wish I could make him clean that mess up with his tongue. Freakin' gross.
