I meant to pre-write this post and have it publish itself yesterday.  Instead, I'll just do it today.  Sorry if anyone was anticipating this one... I was in Iowa City with a couple of friends for the weekend.

Day 5: Something you hope to do in your life.

(I'm not being pressed for time here, it's just a really simple answer, and I have homework I should be doing.)

**I want to get married and have a family**.  Humans aren't meant to spend their lives as single entities, and I've known since my senior year of high school that I wanted a kid or 4.

In fact, depending on how my career turns out, I could foresee myself being the stay-at-home dad, doing remote tech support, web development, or whatever while <insert name of the Mrs. here> goes to work.  Many guys would think that's weird.  I'd be perfectly ok with that.

Something a little more finite, though... well, I'd love to go to Boston and catch a Red Sox/Yankees series, I'd love to own a great camera (Canon 40D, anyone?), travel to England... there's a [whole big list of this stuff](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2010/02/08/my-personal-bucket-list/) that I've posted before.
