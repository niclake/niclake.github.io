Oh, hello there strep throat.  I didn't see you there sneaking up on me like that.

Rawr!!!

Needless to say, I've been awake since 8:30 on a Saturday... boo.  Oh well, more time to get stuff done.  Including blogging for the day.

Day 11: Something people seem to compliment you the most on.

The thing that's gotten me the most compliments throughout my life has been **_my musical abilities_**.  First piano, then percussion, and now guitar.  Seems to happen all the time, too.

My ego thanks you.

My throat is telling me to go back to sleep.  So I'm abiding.
