What's the biggest regret that you have in your life?

![](images/regret-785852.jpg)

This is always an interesting question to ask of your friends.  Depending on the age range and the type of person you ask, you can get responses ranging from "your mom" to "well, there was this drunk night...", all the way through some really deep, philosophical musings that a person may have carried through their entire life.  That, or you'll get the "I don't regret anything I've done in my life" answer.  Child, please.  Everyone regrets things... that's part of human nature.  No one is perfect, and you're bound to have made a mistake or 50 in your life.  I think the proper response those people could give is "I don't let the regrets I have run/ruin my life".  That would be more appropriate.

My dad's always instilled in me the importance of keeping possessions and not selling them.  He's sold a lot of things over the years (the ones that immediately come to mind are camera equipment, and a car he won playing poker in Germany), and always says "man, I wish I wouldn't have sold that".  His mentality has led me to hold on to a bass amp that I would've sold long ago, as well as selling my bass to my church instead of some random person (since church will let me borrow it whenever I need to).  I've sold a couple of things I wish I hadn't... a guitar effects processor and a mini-amp that would be super to have sitting around right now, as well as an Xbox 360 come to mind immediately.

Anyway, someone asked me just the other day what it was that I regretted most about my life up to this point (since my birthday is in a week), and it got me thinking.  Lots of people have some of the obvious things... selling something they didn't want to, messing things up with an ex, not studying before a test (that's more short-term), or the like.  I have all of those, as well as the whole concussion + depression = leaving school ordeal (among others).  Strangely enough, though, none of those things top my list when I really sit down and think about it.

**My biggest regret?  Giving up playing piano when I was in high school.**

I've played piano since I was 4 1/2 years old.  For as long as I can remember, my mom's been a piano teacher, and so I was pretty much immersed in music since I was born.  This is definitely not a bad thing.  There's pictures of me somewhere sitting up on the piano bench banging away at the keys as a little one.  Anyway, when I was about 4 or so, my mom decided to start getting me lessons.  She had the brilliant idea that having another teacher once a week would be more beneficial for me in the long run, and would cause less tension in the household.  (This is probably akin to LeBron James sending his kid to LA to have basketball lessons with Kobe once a week, and then working with him back in Cleveland the rest of the time.)  If she was right, I would hate to imagine what our house would've been like had she been my only teacher.

So I went from age 4 1/2 to age... I think it was 16 or 17... with piano in my life.  Every day.  Correction, every (most) morning.  With her having to teach, and my dad being the one that usually transported me to school, I would have to get my practicing done and out of the way before I went to school.  This definitely helped me develop into being more of a morning person (I was always cranky, but at least I could get up), but let me tell you... it sucked.  If school started at 8:05 am, that means that I would be at the piano at 6 (in the later years) for an hour and a half of practice every morning before school started.  Then Tuesdays after school, we'd load up and drive 30 minutes to Wartburg College so I could have my lesson w/ Dr. Ted Reuter.

I'm going to have a slight moment where I let my ego shine through a little, so bear with me...

From about 2nd/3rd grade until I quit in high school, I was one of the best youth piano players in the state of Iowa, if not the best.

Ok, ego moment done.

And then one morning, while I was practicing, I felt a twinge in my wrist.  Kind of one of those "hrm, what was that" moments.  I kept playing, and then the twinge became discomfort, and then pain.  My mom thought it was just one of my patented attempts to get out of practicing (let me tell you, I got most of my deviousness from figuring out ways to get out of practicing, or at least lessen the time I was there), but it definitely wasn't.  Long story short, the doctor would go on to diagnose me with tendonitis in my right arm, which would eventually sideline my pursuit of music education and percussion.

This, coupled with some health issues my mother began to deal with around this time, led to a pretty rapid decline in everything.  As I had become an extremely good percussionist in the past couple of times, I think my mother felt ok with letting me stop playing... at least it was a musical pursuit.  I'd go on to be a 2-time All-State percussionist, and I knew she was thrilled for me, but I secretly think she was disappointed because it wasn't the piano.

As much as I disliked practicing the piano, I really do miss playing it.  I'm sure if I had some free time, I could sit down and pick up the skills again... but it'll never be the same.  I'm really grateful for the time I spent learning the music in general, though.  Without it, I wouldn't have been nearly as good of a percussionist as I was, nor as good of a guitarist as I am now.  Hopefully one day, I'll be able to get a piano in my home and get back into playing.  Who knows, maybe I'll get my kids into it as well.
