Wow, this has been a rough day.  Holy crap.  Good thing I can still update my blog while I'm on-the-go.

Day 14: Something or someone you couldn’t live without, because you’ve tried living without it.

This is another "omg so easy" one.  **_Music_**.

I remember going to the Boundary Waters with the Boy Scouts for 10 days.  It was an absolute blast... and yet I was miserable the entire time, because I didn't have my CD player with me.  You know, didn't want to drop it in the rivers/lakes or anything.

Even now, it's hard for me to go without for a day.  And it's terribly difficult to fall asleep at night if I don't have any music playing.

Not like I have a problem with any of this.  I love listening to music.  I've said it day in and day out, I'd much rather lose my sight, smell, taste, and touch rather than my hearing.  If I couldn't hear... well, I'd rather die.

 

Yeah, sorry... I can't write right now.  Not in a good mood, at all.
