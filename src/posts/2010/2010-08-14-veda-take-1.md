So, after watching the fun that several other bloggers were having with [Vlog Every Day in August](http://www.writingtoreachyou.com/veda/) (or VEDA), I decided to jump on the bandwagon today and do my own entry.

Yes, today is August 13th, I am aware.

Most of these VEDA posts I've seen are pretty cool, going off the topic of the day, and last about 3 minutes or so.  Me?  I decided to play catch-up, and as such, you get to enjoy 9:30 of me talking about anything and everything... and being a bit of an idiot.

So without further ado... VEDA, take 1.
