Day 16: Something you wish you hadn't done in your life.

_**I can't think of anything**_.  Seriously, I've tried to think of one, but I can't.  I wish I hadn't hurt my arm... but then I'd still be a music ed. major.  I wish I hadn't dropped out of school... but then I'd be in a major I didn't enjoy.  I wish I hadn't dated J... but then I wouldn't have the life experience that it gave me.  Seriously, I don't regret things, I learn from them and make the best of what they give me.

Day 17: Something you wish you had done in your life.

I really wish I would've _**learned better study habits when I was younger**_.  I have no regrets about how my college career has gone, but I still feel like I struggle with studying somedays, and if I'd worked on developing those habits earlier, it would've been a huge benefit for me now.  Too bad we can't know these things when we're young, right?  (Honestly, I probably didn't develop them simply because my parents told my I should.  Yay, rebellion!)

Day 18: What do you think of religion/politics?

Religion: I'm a Christian, and so obviously I think religion as a whole is good.  However, I can't stand the people that use their religion as a crutch, either hindering them from advancing in life or utilizing it as a weapon in order to meet their goals.  I believe that at the core of every religion is a set of solid values which help any human being live a better life, both for themselves and for those they interact with on a day-to-day basis.

Politics: I hate politics.  There are days that I want to learn all I can about politics, become President, and then tell everyone "Hey!  No more politics!  This shit is dumb!!!"  Seriously, my least favorite times are the 4ish months leading up to elections, when I'm flooded with campaign messages, both the promises that a candidate makes (and will never fulfill) and the slander their opponents are throwing their way.  I hate it so much.
