1/3 of the way done... well, after today, that is.  This is quite the interesting project.  Most of the posts are able to be kept short and sweet, so this is truly just a nice little "get in and get out" month of posts.  And I can dig that.

Quick note: you know those guido guys that always wear way too much cologne?  Well, there's a girl in this computer lab that's rockin' the Snooki look, and has a massive (MASSIVE) amount of perfume on.  She's sitting in the back corner of the room, and I can smell her from here.  And it's not a good smell either... blech.

Anyway.

I'm calling an audible today.  Today's topic is supposed to be "someone you need to let go, or wish you didn't know".  But, a) I don't have anyone like that in my life, and b) I'm tired of all the negativity I post on my blog.  So... without further ado...

Day 10: What city would you like to live in?

Great question!

Well, I've actually thought this over previously.  So you get a long post today.

First, I have requirements.  You know... things that I feel I ought to have if I make the move to a different city.  They are, in no particular order:

- sports (gotta have a good sports team nearby)
- big cities
- mid/late 20s social scene (since I'm approaching that very quickly)
- technology hub (usually goes hand in hand with the "big city" thing)
- good/great/awesome music scene
- great food (boo, McDonalds...)
- decent weather

None of those are an option.  Those are all requirements.  I hope the "sports" thing doesn't paint me in a tool-ish light.  :-(

So, let's compare my 2 favorite sports here.  First, we have baseball.  Cities with baseball teams I enjoy watching?  Boston, Philly, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Chicago, and LA.  Then there's football... Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Philly, New Orleans, and New York (the Jets).  That narrows it down to Minneapolis and Philly.  But, MN is REALLY cold (colder than Iowa, routinely), and I know absolutely nothing about Philly.  Which is slightly unfortunate.

In the long run, I narrowed it down to a few candidates, and here's the results I came up with, complete with pros and cons.  (These are ordered in terms of my ideal locations, rather than weighing all the pros/cons against each other.)

**#5: Minneapolis**.  Home to the Vikings (Woo!) and the Twins (acceptable), as well as an NBA and NHL team (if you can call those "teams"... they're pretty bad).  It has a fantastic music scene, some great things to do in and around the area (plus, I can just go chill at the Mall of America every day... the 23-year-old mall rat.  Hah!), and it's within about 4-5 hours of home, which is convenient.  However, it gets COLD up there/around here in the winter, and I wonder if it's just too close to home.  Maybe.

**#4: Texas**.  Really city-specific, I know.  My options are wide open... Austin, San Antonio, maybe Dallas... who knows.  Lovely weather, good sports teams, yummy food, great music... yeah.  I just wonder if that would be too much of a culture shock for me, moving to Texas.  I was a bit wigged out when I just traveled through on my way to Mexico.  Plus, the weather could sometimes be too much.

**#3: LA/SF/West Coast** (best coast).  Again, really specific.  Seattle is in this grouping as well, I guess.  Again, weather/sports/music scene/location (omg a beach) are huge.  The west seems to be \*the\* technology hub as of late, which is great.  Tons of opportunities for me out there, which would help me ease into the transition more.  But, the cost of living and the distance from home would be massive, and I really only know one person out there (that being [Nico](http://www.nicopolitan.com) in LA), so there is that.

**#2: Kansas City**.  I absolutely fell in love with this city this summer when I traveled there for work.  Currently, it's exploding with the Gen-Y-ers from the midwest looking for a place to settle.  It seems to be just big enough for me to consider it a "big city", yet it's still small enough for me to be able to get around easily.  The food there... omg.  I <3 good BBQ.  Throw in the fact that I know a handful of people in and around the area, and it looks great.  But, it's another case of "maybe too close to home?", being cold, and not having great sports teams (although look at the Chiefs go... last undefeated team in the NFL this year...)

And my #1 location (which should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed this blog before)... \*drumroll\*

**Boston**.

Why Boston?  It's got everything.  Youth, size, sports, tech, music, food... it's all there.  The weather can get crummy... and damn, do I hate the Patriots (although, thanks for trading us Randy Moss.  I appreciate it)... but damn, do I love the Red Sox.  I'd spend so much money in Boston, between housing and trying to get my hands on as many Red Sox tickets as I possibly could.  I'll probably never move there for that exact reason.

So there it is.  My top 5.  **Boston, KC, West Coast, Texas, and Minneapolis**.

There were some other cities that were definitely in contention... Nashville and the Colorado Springs/Denver areas come to mind.  Some that failed to even be considered?  New York (too big/expensive), Chicago (EVERYONE is going there... I wouldn't mind visiting though), Atlanta (a wee bit too ghetto for me), and anywhere in Florida (I gotta have a retirement plan).

So there it is.  Nearly 1000 words explaining where I'd like to live.  I was originally going to vlog about this, but that probably would've taken me hours to do, and the video would've been 20 minutes.  And I know the attention spans that most of you have.  So I went back and bolded the list for you, so you can just scroll through for your synopsis.  You're welcome. :-P
