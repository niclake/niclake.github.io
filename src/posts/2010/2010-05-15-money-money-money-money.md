![](images/money%20large.jpg)Obviously, I don't think that anyone would consider me to be the "norm" in any aspect.  Normal is no fun anyway.  But when I look at the things that some people do, it really just makes me scratch my head and think "was I really raised that differently than you?"  (I've been meaning to write this post on a particular person for a couple months now, and I've just now gotten around to it, so some of my details may be fuzzy.)

Here's the current example:

I know 2 guys named "Steve" and "Jimmy" (not their real names).  Steve and Jimmy are pretty nice guys.  We don't really interact much, but when we do, we get along great, able to talk about any number of things, etc.  Both of these guys are musicians, and pretty darn good ones at that.

Both of these guys come from families that are much better off than my family is.  I'm not saying that these guys are super rich, or that my family's down in the poverty level, but it is what it is.  Anyway... I'm not sure how these two came to acquiring their guitar equipment that they have today, but they did.  A couple months back, they had some pretty nice stuff, stuff that I wouldn't mind having in my rig (and/or might, in a few short months).

But here's the thing that gets me... these two will buy things, things they haven't even tried out, then turn around and sell them months/weeks later.  From the outside, it's almost as though they don't spend any money, but rather they sell the things that they have in order to finance new purchases.  I remember not seeing "Steve" for about 2 months, and the next time I did, his equipment was radically different, and I was just like "bwah?!?"

Now, as a musician, I can understand the need and desire to modify one's sound.  A true musician strives to find the sound that they believe best encompasses their playing and personality, and doesn't ever stop until they figure it out.  And even when they do figure it out, their mentality has probably changed over time, which requires them to continue this pursuit.  But... idk.  Me?  I've sold 3 guitar-related pieces of equipment in my entire life, and these were things that I knew I was never, ever going to use again.

I've watched/heard both of these guys rant and rave over how \*piece of equipment X\* is so sweet/awesome/rad/whatever, and I can't wait to buy it!  Often times, this positive energy that they feel has a direct correlation to the price of the object (higher price, more "awesome").  Then they buy it, apparently without having actually tried the product out for themselves before hand, are dissatisfied, and turn around and sell it used just a short time later.  The fire sales that these guys have just baffles me.

Does that not seem a little messed up to you?  'Cause it sure does to me.

Or another friend, "Jim Bob".  I went with Jim Bob to buy a TV once.  He knew exactly what he wanted (how he came to this decision, I'm not sure, but he did), and we walked straight back to the TV section and asked the department workers to bring out that TV.

"Oh, sorry, we're all out."

Bummer, right?  Come back next week.  Not Jim Bob.  Jim Bob immediately looks around the TV department for another TV of comparable monetary value, and goes "yeah, I'll just get this one instead".

Ok, listen.  Maybe I'm just wise because I'm older than all 3 of these guys (I say this at age 23, when I know it's a bad idea to put tinfoil inside a microwave but I do it anyway...), or maybe I'm just more intelligent with my purchases because I've been through a money crisis (thanks, Mom and Dad, for helping me out).  Or maybe it was the way my dad raised me.  I really don't know.  But to me, any purchase over $50 (hell, any purchase over $20), I'm damn sure I know EXACTLY what it is that I want.  I've had a plan in mind for what I wanted to finish my guitar pedalboard for... over a year now.  I knew exactly how I was going to lay it out, exactly what pedals I thought I would put in there, etc. etc.  Just for kicks, I went to Guitar Center this week, because I figured "eh, might as well do some first-hand research".  Turns out, what I thought I wanted sucked.  What I thought was "meh" actually rocked my face off.  3 planned purchases became 1 planned purchase, which saves me a LOT of money.

So when Jim Bob just went and grabbed a TV, I was like "whoh... hang on".  I didn't try and talk him out of it (it's his money), but I started pointing things out, like ports in the back of the TV, contrast ratio, and other things that are important.  None of it really seemed to matter to him, and in the end, he walked out of the store with a TV that I wouldn't even give 2 seconds of thought about purchasing, all because of the price.  He's happy with it, so I guess that's all that matters, but... damn.

For me, there's 2 things that I've had driven into my brain by both my father, and my own life experiences: 1) Don't sell things unless it's a dire emergency... especially those things that relate to what you enjoy about life.  And 2) Do your homework, and don't make rash decisions.  He always tells me about equipment that's he's sold, whether it was a car, or camera equipment, or various other things that he looks back at and thinks "man, I wish I still had that".

Anyway, I just have to ask all of you out there... do you research before you spend your money?  Do you just kinda wing it because it "looks nice"?  Is price the ultimate deciding factor in the purchases that you make, or do you value quality much higher?
