I ran across this idea today as I was cleaning out my techno-life... someone saved their RSS feed from deletion for at least a little while longer for giving me the idea.  The concept is, here's 30 topics to blog about, mostly on a personal level.  Go nuts.  She (and in turn, I) am taking it one step further, by doing these in consecutive days.  I already know I'm going to run into a bit of a hangup on this, simply because I'm going out of town this weekend.  Oh well, at least I know Reid has wifi in his residence.

So without further ado...

Day 1: Something you hate about yourself.

Tons of different things I could've put down here.  Literally.  I could've spent the rest of the week writing on this.  And yet, through all the imperfections, there is one glaring thing that stands out: **_I am extremely impulsive_.**

Now, don't get me wrong, spontaneity is awesome.  My ex and I randomly decided to take a trip to Minneapolis one weekend, on 2 day notice.  One of the best times I had with her.  On the other hand, I bought her a $300-pair of earrings completely on impulse.  I'm sure she loved them, and it was near her birthday, so it made it alright.  But it was a completely impulsive and (looking back) idiotic purchase.

To me, that's the biggest difference... spontaneity is random, whereas impulsive is stupidly random.  Normally, I aim to be neither of these, and strive to be structured in how I spend my time, but I've discovered that any attempt at getting a group of college students to base their time off of scheduled events rarely works (see: any time I ever go disc golfing).  So I've learned to go with the flow, roll with the random, and just enjoy life as a faux-spontaneous person.

But it's my impulsiveness that gets me in trouble.  The part of me that acts upon a random thought without letting it fully form in my mind.  9 times out of 10, a person's impulsive behavior revolves around spending money.  Over the course of the past 2-3 weeks, I've visited the Apple Store website no fewer than a dozen times, looking at their iPads and contemplating purchasing one.

Thankfully, I've learned to control those impulses a little bit better over the years, though it's still tough.  I got rid of my credit card for quite a while, which helped... maybe I should knock the limit on this platinum card down again.
