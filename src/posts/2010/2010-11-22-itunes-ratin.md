![](images/itunes9icon.png)I was talking with one of my friends Jason the other day, and the topic got on iTunes and how we sort our music.  As of right now, I have 19141 songs (57 days, 2 hours, 59 minutes, and 53 seconds, or 91.91 GB) in my library.  That's way too much for one person to have, I think.  I used to have nearly 22,000 but I've been cleaning music out utilizing this process.

I use a whole boatload of playlists for various things... certain bands I like, my favorite albums, and so forth.  Truly, though, there are only 3 playlists that I use on a regular basis, and this is in an effort to weed out all these bands/albums that I just don't listen to, for whatever reason.  To do what I do requires a bit of setup, and a lot of future discipline, but it helps you weed out all the crappy songs, no matter what song your library is.

What you need: 1) iTunes (obviously) 2) Quicksilver (optional, but definitely nice to have... [get it here](http://www.blacktree.com/))

**Step 1: Enable ratings.** - Ratings are available by default, but not necessarily viewable.  In order to make them viewable, go to View > View Options... and check the Rating box.  You may have to do this for every playlist that we make down the line.

**Step 2: Set the beginning ratings.** - Select all of your songs (click on one song, then ⌘-A), right click (or control-left click) on one of the songs, and go to Rating > 3 stars.  (Note: if you have pre-existing ratings for some songs that you've 4- or 5-starred, you can leave those if you'd like.)

**Step 3: Make playlists.** - As I said, there are only 3 playlists that I routinely listen to, and I'm going to help you set them up.

First, if you've never used a smart playlist before, this will be a good learning experience for you.  iTunes has the regular playlist, which lets you dump songs of your choosing into them at will, and smart playlists, which gather songs into them based on criteria that you set up for them.  Smart playlists are great for automation, so you don't have to do anything.

To make a smart playlist, just go to File > New Smart Playlist...  Then, set yours up just like mine (you'll be able to name them after you put the rules in place).

**Top Rated** Rating | is greater than | 3 stars

This playlist consolidates all of your high-rated songs into one playlist.  I have 423 songs, or 2.2% of my total library in this playlist.  This is the playlist I listen to the most frequently when I'm on the go, as well as the only one I have on my iPad.

**All Decent Music** Rating | is greater than | 2 stars

This is the playlist I listen to when I'm sitting at my computer, writing blog posts (like right now), reading e-mail, and surfing the web.  This keeps everything that hasn't been down-rated available for you to listen to and rate at your leisure.  Currently has 19010 songs, or 99.3% of all my total library in it.

\[caption id="attachment\_804" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Latest Additions"\][![](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/screen-shot-2010-11-22-at-9-41-32-am1.png?w=300 "Latest Additions screenshot")](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/screen-shot-2010-11-22-at-9-41-32-am1.png)\[/caption\]

**Latest Additions** Match ALL of the following rules: (be sure that it's on ALL, not ANY) Date Added | is in the last | 2 | weeks\* Kind | contains | AAC audio Plays | is less than | 3\*

This one is more of a "how you like it" playlist.  Some people have this set at 1 week, some at 4.  Some people only need 1 listen to judge the song, others need more.  You also may not need the "Kind contains..." option (I only include it because I'll sometimes import mp3's, and I end off converting everything over to AAC to save space).  I only have 89 songs in this playlist at the moment.  You'll also notice the XXX tag before the title... don't get any ideas.  I just do that so it shows up at the bottom of my list.

**Step 4: Start rating!** - Now start listening to your music.  I always have iTunes on random, either by album or (lately) by song.  If you hear a song you like, go into iTunes and rate it up.  Don't like it?  Rate it down, and the smart playlist will automatically kick it out and get you on to the next song.

Here's how my rating scale works: 1 star - If I never listened to it again, I'd be perfectly happy. 2 stars - Song wasn't doing it for me when I heard it. 3 stars - Good enough to hear every once in a while, but not a favorite. (Most of my music has this rating.) 4 stars - I like this song, and would like to hear it again. 5 stars - One of my favorite songs.

So everything in my Top Rated playlist is only songs that I want to listen to, and everything in All Decent Music is either things I like for the variety, or just haven't gotten around to rating yet.  Trust me, once you get it set up, you'll love it.  I promise!

Over time, you can decide what you want to do with the 1- and 2-star songs.  Some people delete them, other people (like me) like having complete albums.  If a certain artist appears in my 1 star list too much, I may end off deleting all their stuff.  It's totally up to you.

I hope this guide helped you out a bit.  Feel free to leave your own ideas/ways of managing your library in the comments. :-)

**OPTIONAL:** Want an easier way to rate, rather than having to click over to iTunes and interrupt your work flow?  Here's where Quicksilver comes into play.  This is a little bit involved, but for you QS users out there, you might find this handy.

**Step 1: Download and install Quicksilver.** (easy)

**Step 2: Enable the iTunes module.** - Go into the Quicksilver settings (call the app via the key command you assigned, then right click and select Preferences),  select All Modules, and search for iTunes.  Select it.  Done.

**Step 3: Assign abbreviations.** - QS lets you assign abbreviations to actions, so you can call certain commands with specific button presses.  Call QS via your normal key command, then type until you get "Set Rating To #.scpt" (with # being a number between 1 and 5... ignored the 0 script, we don't need it).  Instead of hitting enter, hit Tab to get over to the next mini-window (probably says Run by default).  Type in "Assign Abbreviation..." until it shows up, then tab over to the 3rd window and type in what abbreviation you want.  I set these to "sr#" (again, # being what rating I want, 1-5).  Then hit enter, rinse and repeat for the other numbers.

**Step 4: Start rating!** - Now, whenever you're listening with iTunes in the background, you can rate the song without moving away from what you're currently working on.  For example, I'm listening to Metallica's "Disposable Heroes" right now... not doing it for me.  Call QS > SR2 > enter.  It's instantly rated to 2 stars, moved out of my All Decent Music playlist, and the next song start playing.  Super convenient.
