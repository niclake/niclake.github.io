[![](http://rootsandrings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/rr10tuesday.jpg?w=125&h=125&h=125)](http://rootsandrings.wordpress.com/)**1. Quick! Zombies are coming!! What do you do?** I go find some of my friends that have weapons. I have none. Freakin' lame.

**2. Whew, that was a close one. …I think your phone is ringing. Oh, it’s your best friend! She thinks she’s been bitten by a zombie. What advice do you give her?** You've been bitten? Get the hell away from me!

**3. You realize it’s time to leave your current location because it’s clearly not safe anymore. Are you going to move at night or day? Defend your reasoning.** Day. Zombies have the scare factor, so I want to see them coming. Plus, my aim is better in the day. Muzzle flash is a bitch, from what I understand.

**4. During your relocation, you come across a weapon superstore. My, that’s convenient. What kind of weaponry do you choose?** Shotguns. While that means the zombies get closer, it gives you more of an opportunity to take them out in one shot. Besides, all the horror movies you see always involve zombies trying to bust down your door... I'd say that's pretty close range.

**5. As you leave, an old lady on the side of the street begs you to help her. Do you? Why or why not?** Sure. She'd come in handy later for the "I don't have to outrun the zombies, I just have to outrun you" mentality. ;-)

**6. Good choice, you’re clearly a good person to have around in a zombie apocalypse. Oh hey, there’s a wifi signal here! You can’t stay long but this is your chance to gather some intel on the current situation. What’s the first website you check?** ESPN. I'm sure they have some sort of score. Zombies 1,428,537 - Humans 30,498,298,509. Yet, something tells me the zombies would still be winning... freakin' lame!

**7. SHH! What was that noise?!** OY! Stop having sex in here! We've got to keep quiet, or the zombies will find us. You wanna boink, you stay alive first!

**8. I think it’s time to get out of here. I hope you have a plan. Where are you going now?** Take car. Go to Mum's. Kill Phil - "Sorry Phillip!" - grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over. How's that for a slice of fried gold? (name the movie)

**9. Wait a minute, that looks like a bite mark on your arm… You may be infected too! Will you tell other people?** I will be the über-zombie. Everyone shall fear me. Think Blade vs. vampires, only sans sword.

**10. How does this story end?** Probably pretty horrifically. Hopefully I do something stupid like blow up a gas station or something.
