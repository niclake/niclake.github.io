Before I begin, I need to say something.  Cheap sparklers (a LOT of them) and some masking tape can be a whole lot of fun.  You remember those little packs you'd get as kids?  And how they come in packs of 6 boxes?  At the New Year's party I attended, we took 9 of those packs (54 boxes), taped all the sparklers together, and lit them.  That stuff goes up quick, and is incredibly bright.  Add a few firecrackers and we'd have our own 4th of July show.

![](images/Black_Jack2.jpg)Anyway... last night, I was sitting here watching the Florida beatdown of Cincinnati, when I hear Doug yelling down the hallway at me.  He eventually makes his way to my room, and our conversation went something like this...

Doug: What are you doing tonight? Me: Um... watching football?  I don't know. Doug: Wanna go to the casino with me and Jeremy? Me: (never been to a casino before) Eh... I don't think so... I don't want to lose money. Doug: I'll spot you $10. Me: I'll get my coat.

As stated above, I have never been to a casino before.  Ever.  The most gambling I've done is playing poker with friends.  My only interaction with a casino has been watching TV shows or movies.  I honestly had no idea what to expect.  Thankfully, Jeremy and Doug had both gone previously, so they knew what to expect and coached me through it.

I remember walking into the casino, and something my dad said once ran through my head.  Via general paraphrasing... "TV shows and movies lie to you.  They always show people having fun and winning at the tables.  You'll rarely find that in a casino."  He was right... there's the bright lights and sounds that are designed to pull you in and get you to play, but 90% of the people that I saw looked like there weren't having any fun whatsoever playing slots or whatnot.

Long story short... After Doug and Jeremy played a few rounds of penny slots, they wanted to play blackjack. Doug forgot to mention that playing blackjack has a minimum of $5.  Had I known this, I wouldn't have gone.  By the time I was there, though, I was kinda hooked.  I was there, and I figured what the hell, might as well give it a shot.  You only live once, right?  I've never played blackjack for anything more than just fun.  I've never gambled this much.  The odds were against me, and had I not had 2 people (plus some other patrons) that knew the game at my table, I would've lost all my money.  Instead, after about 45 minutes, I was up $30 (I put in Doug's $10, plus $10 of my own).  I went on a bit of a cold streak when dealers changed, lost 3 hands, and decided to step away, being up $15.  Doug and Jeremy also walked away with an extra $55 and (I think) $35.  $95 of house money added to our pockets.

Feeling pretty good, we decided to go celebrate by having a drink and playing darts at the Library.  I wish I was better at darts.  Anyway, during the course of our celebrations, I said something to the general effect of "man... we should go back.  We were doing good!"

For those not familiar with gambling... this is bad.  Very bad.  If you stop, stop.  Don't go back, especially if you're losing.  Also, the fact that it was about 1:30/2 AM made this an even worse decision.

But back we went.  At around 2:30, we made it back into the casino, made our way to an empty table, sat down, and played.  It started off bad for me... I put in $20 again, fluctuated a lot, and eventually lost it all.  Doug and Jeremy, on the other hand, were having great success, so I sat back and watched.  After about 10 minutes though, I was itching to get back in.  Assuming I was going to really really regret my decision, I put in $20 (yes Mom, this is all money that I've had saved for "fun things", so stop freaking out, put the phone down, close the e-mail you were writing to me, and relax) and started playing again.

And won.

3 first-card aces in a row.  About 4 or 5 blackjacks (which pay back 150% of the original bet).  Lots of dealer busts.  Friendly dealers.  I doubled up relatively quickly, set $40 aside (the $20 I'd bought in with, plus the original $20 I'd lost) and kept playing with the rest.  After 2 dealer changes in about 5-10 minute and some shoddy hands, I decided to call it a night after breaking even, sit back, and watch the action.  Apparently, taking myself out of the rotation set up the deck perfectly for Doug and Jeremy, and they absolutely raked in the winnings.

By the end of the... morning?... I had 2 positive gambling experiences, and the three of us had taken in $225 of the casino's money.  Obviously, now I have it in my head that gambling is good and fun.  This is a very very bad lesson for me to have learned.  But, I celebrated 2010 by winning $15 for myself, so I can't really be too upset by this, can I?

This is some really shoddy writing.  It's "early", and I'm still kinda tired.  I apologize.

Mom, seriously.  Put down the phone.
