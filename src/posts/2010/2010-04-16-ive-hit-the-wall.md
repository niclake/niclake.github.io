I had a breakdown tonight. I hit that metaphorical wall that life likes to stick in front of us on occasion. Still not sure what material it was made out of... all I know is that it was solid, and it hurt like a bitch.

![](images/brick_wall11254935255.jpg)This is actually the first breakdown since I was "unofficially" let go from John Deere a little over a year ago. Considering all that's gone on in that amount of time, I'm pretty shocked that it's taken this long for it to hit.

The sad/scary thing about this particular breakdown is, it's not like a whole bunch of bad things are piling up on me. Quite the opposite. I'll go into specifics later, but just thinking about it, it's about a 60/40 distribution of good things to bad.

Eh, screw later, I'll just get to specifics now.

1) The obvious, school. This semester's not going as well as the last, but that's due in part to me taking more difficult classes. I've still got 3 weeks and a ton of points to help make things a bit more to my liking. While everything that I'm doing is acceptable by the school's terms (and society's, in general), I still have those thoughts of "I could do better".

1.5) One of those classes has an assignment due Tuesday. #5 will explain why I'm not totally thrilled about that.

2) I hate winter. I destroyed a lot of really good things in my life this winter, solely because it's such a depressing time for me. Not really sure why, either... I can't tie any of my bad memories to the winter. Maybe it's just not getting out and about and doing stuff that makes it suck so hard. Sure is pretty that time of year, though (except for the ice on my windshield... that stuff can go to hell, and hopefully melt a bit while it's there).

3) Along with school... my past lethargic-ness and terrible study habits are coming back to bite me. Due to my not-up-to-snuff GPA, I'm unable to keep myself on the class schedule that I had planned out for myself. As such, I'm taking extra classes (they're gonna be easy) in order to help boost my GPA so I can register for my 100-level courses. Now, instead of having 3 semesters of only 4 courses, I only get 1 (my final semester, 1.5 years from now). LAAAAAME. Oh well, at least the extra classes are a) easy and b) in the Computer Science department with a good professor. There's worse things.

4) I hate talking money with my parents. Always. Even if I'm doing a whole lot better about it all (which I am). It always turns into a conflict, whether that was the intention or not. Blah.

5) Some friends and I thought it would be a great idea to go to Minneapolis for a baseball game this weekend. Bryce is a Royals fan, and Zeke is a Twins fan... lo and behold, a series this weekend! And a game that's going to feature both team's best pitchers (Greinke vs. Baker). I'm really pumped about this... except for the fact that it's taking away from my time here, studying, getting homework done (what I discussed in 1.5... actually, all 3 of us are in that class, and have the assignment to do), and so forth. But, the last thing I'm going to do is dwell on that... it's the perfect time to get away and have a mini-recharge break before hitting the last 3 weeks of the school year full-force.

6) My arm's acting up again. I've played 7 rounds of disc golf in the last 2 weeks (still -11 overall, and I haven't had a bad round yet), and apparently that's enough to put me over the edge. I almost couldn't complete the last 3 holes on Tuesday, it was hurting so bad. This annoys me, especially since I've been doing exercises to get my muscles back in shape. I guess there's only so much you can do to repair tendons and ligaments.

7) I'm really pumped about my summer internship. For those that haven't heard... I'm working for Hy-Vee (a regional grocery store) as a Management Information Systems intern (think business + computers), and I'll be traveling all over the midwest doing hardware/software installation and upgrades. I'm making killer money, I'll be getting long hours + travel (and I've heard they pay 2x overtime, instead of the standard 1.5x), and I get to travel. There's absolutely no downsides to the job, from my current perspective. This is absolutely huge for me, since I was stressing for a long time about "OMG what am I going to do this summer?", and now suddenly 3.5 months of my time have been allocated.

8) I've been picking up work shifts like crazy lately. I routinely only work about 12 hours a week (I'm a lab monitor in the business building... NOT a taxing job at all), but lately I've had 18-24 as everyone (well, 1 guy in particular) seems to be intent on giving up as many hours as they possibly can. This works great for me, as it a) gives me extra money and b) gives me more time to get out of my room and interact with people/do homework/read/whatever. Just this week, I've read two books (Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow... the series is fantastic, this is my 4th or 5th time reading them all. Highly recommended), studied, and gotten a lot of personal things accomplished.

9) I'm putting together a business plan with 5 other guys right now. It's pretty awesome, considering that the entire idea/brainstorming session stemmed out of a meet-and-greet session we had earlier this week. The project is obviously still waaaaaaay early in the planning stages, but I think all of us have enough motivation and desire to get something like this up and running. We're keeping it hush-hush about what we've got in mind (and who knows, we may switch gears completely), but needless to say, it's exciting to be interacting and thinking about all of this stuff.

9.5) I pulled out my old marketing notes from this summer in order to discuss/look over a few things that we had in mind. My prof was right... maybe I'll actually use all this stuff they taught me in my other classes! :-P

10) I've decided to do the C25K program this fall. I'd start now, but I'm not really sure what the job's going to offer me in terms of free time, and I'd rather be in a controlled environment like an indoor track when I attempt to run again. I'm also logging everything I eat, in an attempt to get healthy again. Man, wouldn't that rock...

So yeah, even with all that good stuff... idk. The best way to describe it is "damnit, I'm growing up". But I literally hit the wall after my work shift. Got home, shut my door, drank a beer, cried, and watched a bunch of dudes slide around and beat the snot out of each other (playoff hockey time).

Can someone loan me a sledgehammer? I've got school to finish. Build this wall some other time...
