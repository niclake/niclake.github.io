Originally, I had planned on starting a couple of projects over break.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), Hy-Vee has snatched me up for 11 days of my vacation, sending me all over the midwest again to do updates in the stores.

Actually, it sucks.  Because I was going to play a lot of guitar.  And work on [making fun music like this](http://vimeo.com/17859625).  Ambient and post-rock music is some of my favorite... no lyrics getting in the way, leaving room for the instruments to really speak and captivate.  Or even the artists that blend it really well, like Sigur Rós (who just came up on my iTunes)... it's just such incredible music.

Along those same lines... I really want to start a project with you.  Yes, you.  If you are a musician, if you're reading this, and if you're interested in making music via collaborations over the internet... we need to talk.

Style?  I'm not sure yet.  Something post-rock-y, ambient-y... maybe some lyrics?  Maybe a full band?  I truly don't know what direction I want it to take.  I just want to have some fun with it, interact with musicians, and make some cool tunes.

Hit me up on Twitter, or leave a comment and I'll e-mail you.  Or call me, if you're cool unfortunate lucky enough to have my number.

Edit: If anyone wants to make [power speed metal like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jgrCKhxE1s)... well, let me know in advance so I can get some robot arms.
