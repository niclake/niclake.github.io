[![](http://rootsandrings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/rr10tuesday.jpg?w=125&h=125&h=125)](http://rootsandrings.wordpress.com/)Yeah, I know. It's not Tuesday. In my defense, I've been busy as hell with studying for finals and such. At least I'm getting around to it, right? Right.

**1. Do you prefer markers, crayons, or colored pencils?** I'm a big colored pencils guy.  Markers smell and bleed through the pages, and crayons are all sticky and such.  Colored pencils and I were great friends when I was younger.

**2. As a child, how did your parents celebrate your birthday? (Parties, cake, you pick the dinner, etc.)** Small parties, maybe I'd have some friends over to hang out/spend the night.  I remember one time, my parents rented out the Rec Center for me and my classmates.  Most (if not all) of the guys, and 1 girl, were invited.  I didn't have a crush on her, she just fit in with all of the guys.

**3. How do you feel about leggings?** Look, let me tell you about the hideous outfit I saw just last week.  (No, I'm not gay, I just know bad fashion when I see it.)  A gray shirt/dress/whatever you want to call those things.  Pink leggings.  Brown Ugg (Ugh) boots.  A side ponytail.  What, did it get chilly in Jazzercise that morning?  Cripes.

**4. How do you prefer to follow directions? With a map? Words?** I prefer TomTom.  However, since I don't own one (yet), I make do with Google Maps directions of getting to places.  Go x miles on road z, take exit q.  Done and done.

**5. What do you eat for snack?** Depends.  Granola bars, peanuts... whatever I have on hand.  I'm not picky.

**6. Have you ever ordered anything from an infomercial or bought any As Seen on TV products?** I know a few people with Snuggies.  They make me laugh.  No, I have never ordered any of that stuff.

**7. What’s your favorite thing about summer?** It used to be the free time that I had... not this year.  Hopefully it'll be about the great job and the awesome paychecks this summer.  And the nice weather.  But most of all, the break from school.  Nothing could be better.

**8. Do you have a tattoo? What and where is it?** Not yet.

**9. Are you good at journaling?** Depends.  My blog is about as close to journaling as I get, but thankfully, I can usually look back and distinguish what's going on in my life from things like that.  I really just see no reason to dwell in the past... I've done that enough in my life.

**10.  What’s your favorite way to eat a hamburger?** This is a poorly worded question.  The obvious answer here is "Put it in my mouth and chew".  However, what I think the person meant was "what do you like to put on your burgers when you eat them?"  In that case, my answer would be bacon and cheese.  Granite City has this delicious burger that I get when I go there... bacon, cheese, sweet/spicy BBQ sauce, and fried onion strips.  ZOMG delicious.
