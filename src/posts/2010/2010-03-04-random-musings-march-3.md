I go on streaks every once in a while where I have a whole bunch of random thoughts and/or happenings in my life, as well as various quotes I've encountered. Here's some of the recent ones.

1. I got my internship for this summer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm excited.
2. Electric guitars are very solid.  Thus, don't smack yourself in the head with one while making a guitar change.  Knights of Columbus, that hurt!!!
3. I have a lot of really stupid people in a lot of my classes.  Most of them are female (sorry ladies, believe me, I'm not stereotyping here).  Unfortunately, they break the trend at that point by not all being blonde.  If you seriously can't comprehend addition and subtraction, please get the heck out of my classes.  Thanks.
4. Lemmy Kilmister has, quite possibly, the most distinctive voice to ever grace the music industry.  Ever.  I'm not saying the best, I'm just saying the most distinctive.  Don't believe me?  [Go listen to "Ace of Spades"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj4vQCA0fo4), and I promise you'll recognize his voice any time you hear Motörhead ever again.
5. I'm leaving Iowa as soon as I'm done with college.  I've said this before, and I'll keep saying it until it happens.  I love my family, and I like Iowa in general, but I want to be around where things are actually happening, you know?  Possible destinations: Boston (primary option), Austin TX, Nashville, Minneapolis, Chicago, Seattle, St. Louis, Portland, or San Diego.  That is, if I don't move to England.  Or Canada (hooray, free health care!... lol).
6. I have yet to meet anyone as musically diverse as me.  Some people come close, but I have yet to be "trumped".  If I ever meet one, and they're female and cute, I'm marrying them on the spot.
7. On a related note... Nickelback walks into a bar.  There's no punch line to this joke, because ruining music is not funny.
8. I got to [guest-write for Alex Roda](http://www.alexroda.com/?p=4074) before [he](http://www.alexroda.com/?p=4015) [became](http://www.alexroda.com/?p=4154) [famous](http://www.alexroda.com/?p=4171).  I'm not a tagalong, but rather a trend setter.  Alex... send more people to my blog!  K?  K.
9. I wanted to do P90X, and have had offers from 2 people to do it along with them.  However, I can't bring myself to wake up at 5:15, or drive off campus every day, just to get in better shape.
10. That said... I had the best workout I've had in a long time today at the Wellness Center here on campus.  Always refreshing to be able to notice your body getting stronger/leaner.
11. Tumblr is stupid.  It's the midget retard child of Blogger, which is like the 16-year-old "gotta be hip!" high school female of blogs. :-P
12. Whoever coined the term "no pain, no gain" should be beat senseless with a baseball bat. Then again, he'd sue, and be even further ahead...
13. The past 2 days (Monday and Tuesday) were the first days that I had 100+ visitors on consecutive days.  Needless to say, that felt kinda awesome.
14. I'm extremely bummed out that [David is done blogging](http://diamondkt.blogspot.com/) for now.  David was the one that introduced me to [20something Bloggers](http://www.20sb.net/), which has been a great motivation and outlet for all my writing.  His posts have always been funny, informative, and/or beneficial, and it sucks to see someone like that graduating from the community.
15. Individual cell phone plans are expensive.  Ever since I got away from using TracFone, I've shared a plan with my friends.  I think it's finally time for me to graduate into "big boy" world and get my own plan here this fall, but damn, that's a lot of money.  Stupid Sprint and getting me addicted to checking my e-mail from my phone.  (They gave us free data because I yelled at them for unnecessary and unwarranted data charges.  Mwahahahahaha.)
16. ![](images/243893.jpg)I've decided I want to be an Olympic curler.  However, I've been told that doing this will require me to wear the Norwegian-style curling pants (as seen at right).  Oh my...
17. I don't read supermarket tabloids.  I read my Facebook Status Feed.
18. Northern Iowa basketball is turning into the football team.  The football team was ranked as high as #3 in Division I-AA (or the FCS, whichever you prefer) before choking away the end of their season and failing to make the playoffs.  Northern Iowa basketball has been ranked as high as #18 in the polls this year, before a devastating loss to Evansville, the worst team in the Missouri Valley conference (1-15 in conference, and 7-20 overall at that time).  The MVC looks as though they'll only get 1 team into the NCAA tournament this year, which means UNI is going to have to win this weekend's tournament in order to get in.  Ugh.
19. Miley Cyrus' "Party in the USA" is catchy.  Then again, so is AIDS.
20. When I get really tired, I do some really dumb things.  For example, attempting to unlock my parent's front door with my dorm room key.  Or, later that day, attempting to unlock my dorm room with my remote entry for my car.  Oops.
21. The NHL really needs to remove fighting and institute no-touch icing into their rules.  Olympic hockey was completely awesome.
22. It was hilarious to hear Pittsburgh fans give Ryan Miller (USA hockey goalie and MVP of the whole tournament, plays for Buffalo) a standing ovation and boo their hometown favorite Sidney Crosby (scored the game-winning goal against the US).
23. I got invited to the White House Easter egg roll.  I'm not even kidding.
24. [I'm way too much of a nice guy sometimes](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2010/02/27/good-guy-gone-bad).
25. The guy that nearly killed me in driver's ed just joined Facebook today.  He's in the Air Force now.  As such, I'm reconsidering my idea of joining the AF as an officer upon graduation.
26. I don't have nearly enough friends that play Fantasy Baseball.
27. I can't wait for baseball season to start.  Seriously.  I'm so excited.

Man, that's a lot of stuff.  Yikes.  Kudos to anyone that actually reads it.
