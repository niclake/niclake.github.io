Days like today make me really happy I have the past that I do.  That's probably one of the few times you'll ever hear me utter something like that.

I've been out of high school for nearly 5 years now.  Originally, I became a music education (percussion) major, because music was/is my life.  If I had played organized sports, it's possible that music would be in 2nd place, but it's not. However, the muscles and tendons in my arm gave out on me after my first year, forcing me to have surgery and end my percussion career.  At that point, completely lost on what to do with my life, I decided to switch over to Computer Science... we have a great CS department here at Northern Iowa, and they make killer money right out of college, so I figured it was a great decision.

(Interesting side note: my surgeon told me that the 3 leading causes of tendonitis that leads to surgery are playing piano, percussion, and basketball.  When I explained that I had played those for 15, 9, and 12 years, he kinda freaked out a bit.)

Anyway... while I did enjoy some of my CS classes, I realized that I really had no desire to be that immersed in the computers and technology that I had grown up on.  I don't really want to design and code programs the rest of my life, thank you very much.

One of the classes that I took as a CS major was C Programming.  C is a programming language that has been around for a long time, and is relatively easy to comprehend.  I latched onto it immediately, went full-bore into the assignments, and worked on my final project for 2 months.  (There's actually a funny story about my professor printing out 3 copies of my final on accident and getting billed for it... that's just one of the random dumb things he's done.)  However, the following semester, we transitioned into C++, a similar language.  Most people went "Oh, ok, I get this."  I went "seriously, what the \*\*\*\*?!?!?".  That led to the downturn of my enjoyment in the CS program, which I eventually ended up dropping as my major.

Transition now to the present day.  I'm a Management Information Systems major (essentially, business + computers) taking Business Programming.  It's required, so I couldn't get away from it.  We're working with a language called PHP, which I was open-minded about learning.  After a few short weeks in the class, things seemed really familiar about what I was learning... it was almost like I already knew everything, ya know?  So I did a quick Wikipedia search, and what did I discover?  PHP is based off of the C programming language.

It's like a concert pianist trying to learn the organ.  Or a tennis playing walking into a racquetball court.  General differences, but similar enough that memories are invoked.

So yeah, that makes my life a bit easier.  Is that the only reason?  Well... no.

![](images/bellcurve.gif)Remember back in your stats class, how we have the normal distribution?  While it doesn't apply perfectly to this example, it comes darn close.    Some professors choose to skew their grades based on a representation of this curve.  My Macro Economics prof last semester did this... 15% As, 20% Bs, 30% Cs, 20% Ds, and 15% Fs.  (I got an A, thank you very much.)  Anyway, today in class, we got the results of our recent Business Programming test back.  Here's how the grades were distributed...

A: 10 (I'm in this group... I got 40/40) B: 6 C: 0 D: 4 F: 6

38% of people got what most would consider to be less than acceptable grades.  No "average" grades... just good and bad.  As my dad once said, "You really have to try to fail that badly."

Don't get me wrong.  I am not the best student around.  I could be studying for Accounting or Business Stats right now, but instead, I'm watching Russia/Canada hockey and writing this post.  But the difference is, I know what's going on.  Both of those classes, I have friends that I can discuss things with and form study groups with.  Same with Micro Economics.  And Programming is... well, easy.  I have the 2nd highest grade in the class, only because I missed one day with an illness and didn't get to do the in-class assignment.

Seriously... how much money are we all spending to go to college.  I think someone said it's something like $30 for every hour of class we attend.  No one talks in that class.  No questions get asked.

WHY ARE YOU THERE THEN, YOU MORONS?!?!?!?!?

I really feel more like my dad every day, and it comes out more and more in my blogs.  I hope he gets a chuckle out of reading these.

On a side note... that Russia/Canada hockey game?  Yep... 4-1 after 1 period.  Non-stop action in this game.  The only downside: I'm watching on NBCOlympics.com, which is about 1-2 minutes behind everyone else's TV streams... so I have about 5-6 people IMing or Tweeting "GOOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLL!!!!" while there's a stoppage in play.  Rawr.

Oh, and one more thing... how do I put a signature on my WP blog?  Every time I try, I get some stupid gray box that I can't make disappear.  Even if I give the image a white background, the gray will show up as a mini-border.  Help?
