Man, it's been a while... a week since I've posted last.  Sorry about that... to put it mildly, nothing really exciting has happened to write about.  No fun thoughts, no extravagant stories... nothing.

I'm trying out a new blog theme here... you'll have to tell me what you think.  It screws with the "write a new post" page too, for some reason, and I'm not a huge fan of it.

I can't believe that I only have 2 weeks to go.  Not even that, now.  4 days of class, and then finals on Mon., Tues., and Wed.  Yikes.  Grades aren't going to be as good as last semester, which doesn't please me (or my parents), but that's life.  2 more years to go, and I've finally gotten my good study habits down.  I'm ready to kick some ass.  Still bummed that one of my good friends is graduating next week, but that's part of life.  Oh well.

For a self-proclaimed tech geek, I feel kinda weird... today was the first day that I've played video games since spring break... and even then, it was only for about 45 minutes.  I think something's wrong with me.  :-P  I'm sure over the summer, I'll hit them up semi-regularly on the weekends.  Can't bother my parents too much while I'm home.

Man, I'm stoked about this job.  There are some obvious downsides, but hey, I'm growing up and I have to start living like an adult, right?  But, I'm pumped to get this work experience, I'm pumped to make tons of money (from what I hear, up to 70 hrs. a week, with 2x overtime... and I don't pay for housing, gas, or food) and to finish paying my parents back for the money they've loaned me... yeah.  Excited.

So yeah... tell me what you think of the theme.  Hopefully I'll have something fun and insightful to write about soon.
