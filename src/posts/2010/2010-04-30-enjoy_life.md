A little while ago, 20SB.net ran a little blog swap, and asked all participating bloggers to write about their favorite aspect of blogging, and why they do it.  For me, that enjoyment is the freedom that blogging gives me, how I can write about whatever I choose.  This is still true.

But I'd like to add to that a bit.

Most Sunday mornings, you can find me at my church, playing guitar with the band.  We practice usually on Thursday nights, and we always have a bit of "reflection time" before we start.  Tonight, my friend Q said something that kinda stuck with me.  While it was more in reference to scripture and our lives as Christians, I thought it applied well to life as well.  He said:

"Everyone else is blessed by what you enjoy."

While I can think of some obvious reasons why this doesn't apply, it definitely does to a lot life, as well as blogging.  I try to be at least somewhat insightful when I write my blog posts, as to both give people a better look into my mind, and hopefully enlighten a few people now and then.  But what other ways can I see this as being true?  Well...

\- I only read blogs that I enjoy/think I'd enjoy.  Anything from money management, to technology, to one particular girl that's gone through similar relationship stuff as me.  Some I read for insight.  Others for inspiration.  Still others for those good, full body laughs that only some people can produce.  (Oddly enough, John Mayer's blog fits the bill in all of those regards... huh.)

\- Some people like to drink.  I like to hang around certain people when they drink, because it provides great entertainment value.  Also, free drinks.  (This doesn't really classify, but you get my drift.)

\- Q is a fantastic guitar player.  I'm always thrilled when I know he's going to be playing, because he always is able to put me in a great mood, and I always play better when I'm happy.  Tonight's practice was hilarious and amazing.

\- Athletes play their sports because they love the game.  I am in turned blessed, because I love sports, even though I can't really play anymore.  I get to not only watch the best players in the world, but also a bunch of people that truly love the game they play.

\- My dad is a chemist at a pharmacy.  They treat him like shit there.  I could write about 30 posts about the crap that they've pulled.  But he sticks with it, because chemistry is one of the things that he loves.  And as such, he is directly involved with saving the lives of others, or easing the pain of those whos lives can't be saved.

\- Good photographers can capture moments that the rest of us could only dream about.  Concerts, political events, sports, wildlife.  I saw a picture of that volcano in Iceland, where you can see the lightning shooting down through the soot.  It blew my mind.

This same sort of concept relies to our professions and what we do.  My mom teaches piano, and my dad (as mentioned) works at a pharmacy.  They both have aspects of their jobs that they dislike, but in the long run, I think that their positives outweigh the negatives.  For me, school used to be just a place to hang out and have fun.  Now that I'm older and (a little bit) wiser, I see that school is about the long term gain.  You can still have fun too.  Benefits over negatives.

Why would you ever work at a profession that you didn't enjoy?  Why would you submit yourself to working somewhere that you loathed getting out of bed for every morning, a job that you hated even thinking about outside of work?  Instead, I hope someday to work somewhere that I'm excited to go to work every day, and that I've constantly got ideas running through my mind.

So I guess for me, that dream job would somehow tie in working for the Red Sox as a writer, with enough time for guitar and video games on the side.  Oh, and all my work would be on a Mac.  :-P

Don't let anyone else put you down because of what you love to do.  As long as that thing is something productive, something tangible that enriches your life in some way, there's no shame in any of it.

\--- Completely off topic... for whatever reason, I can't get Drake's "Forever" out of my head.  Drake's on Sprite commercial that plays during the NBA playoffs, so that's probably how it got in there in the first place.  And I don't really even like a lot of rap/hip-hop... must be the Travis Barker remix that I'm liking (but I hate Blink 182!  What's wrong with me?!?)  If you're interested, there's a link over on the right to my Tumblr (the Other Stuff column), or you can just [click here](http://niclake13.tumblr.com/).
