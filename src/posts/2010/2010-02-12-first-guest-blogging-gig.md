I want to send out a big, big thank you to [Alex Roda](http://www.alexroda.com) for allowing me to guest-write for his blog.  I met Alex over at [20 Something Bloggers](http://www.20sb.net/) just last week.  One thing led to another, and he was kind enough to lend me his little patch of cyberspace for a while.

Go check out the post ([The Unexamined Life Isn’t Worth Living](http://www.alexroda.com/?p=4074)), and be sure to leave Alex some big "thank you"s for me!
