![](images/BUCKET.JPG)The good people (ok, sorry, Alex the King) over at [20 Something Bloggers](http://www.20sb.net) put the idea into my head of doing a bucket list.  Everyone's always got that list of things they'd like to do/accomplish before they die, and as I near my 23rd birthday, I figured I would join the trend and write my own.  I'm sure that this is just a start, and I'll update it as time goes on.

**General plans:**

1. Graduate college
2. Get an internship for this summer (worked for Hy-Vee)
3. Own a DSLR camera
4. Sell my photography
5. Get my photography published
6. Get some of my writing published
7. Get married (someday)
8. Have children
9. Raise one of my children to be an outstanding professional athlete (hahaha)
10. Own a dog (previously, at least)
11. Own a cat
12. Own my home
13. Fly in an airplane
14. Work at a place for 5+ years

**Sports related:**

1. Go to the World Cup
2. Go to a Manchester United soccer match in England
3. Watch a 3-game Yankees/Red Sox series at Fenway Park
4. Watch a Cubs game/series at Wrigley Field
5. Witness a Cubs World Series championship (pretty much out of my control)
6. Watch a Minnesota Vikings playoff game live
7. Witness a Vikings Super Bowl victory (also out of my control)
8. Watch a live NBA game
9. Go to the NCAA tournament
10. Go to the final of a sporting event (Final Four, World Series, Super Bowl, Stanley Cup Finals, NBA Finals, World Cup)

**Music related:**

1. Purchase a Fender Telecaster, a Gibson Les Paul, and a Taylor acoustic guitar for myself
2. See Muse perform live
3. Go to a handful of outstanding, never-forgotten concerts (MUTEMATH)
4. Get paid to perform at a musical event
5. Get paid a ridiculous sum of money to perform at a musical event
6. Go on a tour with a band (as a musician)
7. Record and sell my own/my band's music

**Places to visit:**

1. Go overseas - China/Japan/Thailand, or England/France/Germany/Spain/etc.  Either would be acceptable.  Both would rock.
2. Go to Chicago
3. Go to Boston
4. Go to Los Angeles (for more than a day)
5. Go to Seattle
6. Go to Texas (whether I move there, or just visit San Antonio/Dallas/Austin for a while)
7. Visit and dine at at least 25 places that Guy Fieri has visited on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives
