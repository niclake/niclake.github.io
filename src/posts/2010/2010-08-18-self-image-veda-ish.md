After a few days off to reflect on this past weekend, I look back and think "wow... that was fun!"  3 vlogs in 3 days as my intro to Vlog Every Day in August (VEDA), even though it's the middle of the month already.  It's a whole different world, both recording these things as well as watching others.  There's something so raw and honest and open that vlogs have over normal blog posts.

[People yesterday](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45EqP1CspeU) [really bared](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX7PW5wgWGE) [their souls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtJ2yFshUy0) in a variety of videos yesterday, and I feel kinda left out because I don't have a working camera here with me on the road.  So instead, I will make a post about it.  Not really sure where this is going to go or what direction it's going to take, but here we go...

- I hate being the shortest person at most social gatherings I attend (I'm 5'7"-ish... when I'm wearing shoes).  Frequently, this will include the men and women present.  I've learned to embrace it, but there are days where I'd pay a lot of money to be just 2 inches taller.
- I'm not the most physically fit kid out there, and part of me wishes I was.  There's a lot of reasons for this desire, but my #1 reason is truly just because I'm not happy.  So, I'm doing something about it and starting P90X with one of my friends on Monday.
- I have horrible eyesight.  Most of you see me in pictures and such without glasses on, but in reality, I have one of the worst prescriptions ever.  I'll have to see if I can get a video done where I don't have a lot of glare on the lenses, so you can see what I mean.  Contacts probably wouldn't cut it, and LASIK is expensive.
- I tend to attribute some of the above things to why my last relationship ended the way it did 3 years ago.  As such, I feel EXTREMELY shy and insecure around the ladies.  Even though my parents both tell me I shouldn't be.  And I know I shouldn't, but I am anyway.
- I have a lisp, and I don't like it.  Some people think it's "cute"... but not me.  It's nothing major, but whenever someone reminds me of it (or I watch a video of myself and realize it), I get insecure for a while.  Unfortunately, watching the videos from this past weekend seemed to amplify that 10-fold, and I haven't been able to let it go since.
- I can't grow facial hair to save my life, while my dad has a full beard and my grandpa has to shave every day.  There are times where I'll go 5-7 days without shaving, just because I don't need to.  (I don't really want a beard anyway, but still...)
- I have always been extremely impulsive, and over the last 3 years, I have become very non-committal.  This is a horrible combination that thankfully hasn't gotten me into too much trouble, but has lost me a couple of friends.
- Related to above... I'm terrible with money management.  Hopefully I'll find a nice woman who's great with keeping track of stuff like that.
- I either babble and ramble like and idiot, or I'm just silent.  There is no in-between for me.  (You've probably noticed from these massive blog posts, eh?)
- I'm a perfectionist, and very stubborn.  For certain things (especially music), this makes me come off like a prick, when I'm honestly just more concerned with making things right.  As such, there are times where I let glaring flaws slide simply because I don't want to cause drama or conflict.
- Instead of combatting my insecurities, I instead find myself sitting behind a computer interacting with people.  This has been the case since I discovered AIM in junior high.  While it's fine in moderation, I've been known to exceed the safe levels and spend way too much time at my desk.
- I let opinions of other people directly influence what I do way too often.
- I get attached to things and people way too easily.  Especially cute girls I could potentially date.  \*sigh\*

There are, however, some things I like about myself.  For example:

- Being short has its advantages.  It gets me noticed, even if it's not for the reasons I'd like.  One of my bosses jokes that I got this job because now he's actually taller than someone (he's about a quarter inch taller than me).
- I continue to combat and defeat depression every day.  Insecurities and loneliness contribute a whole bunch to that depression, and knowing that I have the ability to overcome those gets me through from one day to the next.
- I wouldn't give up my musical talents for anything in the world.  You could offer me the opportunity to be 6' tall, marrying Jessica Alba (or Biel), be completely ripped, making millions of dollars, etc. etc., or the option of retaining my musical talents, and I would take music 8 days a week.  As such, as much as I hated practicing piano when I was younger, I'm so thankful for it now.  (Thanks Mom).
- Even though I have my own issues and can't seem to overcome a lot of them, I'm great at listening to other people and helping them with their problems.  This goes for both personal life, as well as work-related issues.  I seriously get about a dozen calls a week from some of my coworkers that need help with some issues on the job, and each one I get boosts my self-esteem a little bit.

I'm going to cut off the list here, because I'm not trying to write a novel.  I'm not dominated by bad self-esteem or anything, even though it probably looks like it with such a short "good" list.  There's a lot more things that I just don't want to write down right now.

1 more day of work, and then I move back into the dorms.  Huzzah!
