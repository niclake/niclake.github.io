I'm mixing things up today.  Instead of talking about what I should be, I'm going to shuffle the order a bit.

Some strong language will be utilized in this post, because this is a topic I get pretty upset about.  You've been warned.

Day 13: Your views on gay marriage.

Everyone paying attention?  Good.

Today is National Coming Out day.  Kids (or anyone) that have felt shunned by society because of their sexual orientations are to be encouraged in their struggles today, to know that they're not alone, and that there are others out there going through the same things that they are.

I'm not gay, bi, transgendered, or anything of the sort...  I'm straight, and very much so.  As a friend of mine put it, "I like girls, 'cause they have parts that are different than mine!"

... anyway.

The concept that the fuckin' conservative population of America gets to make important decisions (like who can get married to whom) for the rest of the country is asinine.  The fact that parents are ashamed of their own children because they enjoy the companionship of someone of the same gender is just as stupid.  And people that go around promoting/utilizing hate crimes against said people?  I wish I could find every single one of you, and give you the business end of a baseball bat.  Talk about hate crime.

My thoughts on gay marriage are the exact same as my thoughts on a lot of things in life... _**If you're not involved in it, then why the fuck does it bother you???**_ I will never say that I'm totally for gay marriage.  But I'm not against it either.  Since it truly doesn't concern me, I don't worry about it.  However, I \*am\* pro-equal rights.  We should never discriminate against someone, or prevent someone from doing something the rest of America does, simply because they're different from us.

(It's the same as the motorcycle helmet law.  I'm very pro-helmet, but I'm not going to pass a law for something that doesn't affect me in any way.  I don't ride a motorcycle, so why should I have any say in it?  If you think you've got Natural Selection bested, then by all means, pop wheelies down University in your baseball cap.  I still retain the right to laugh at you.)

Remember that whole Equal Rights movement of the late 50s/early 60s?  They were discriminated against because of their skin color.  We have a whole new Equal Rights fight now, for people that are discriminated against for their sexual preference.

This is what is such a huge problem with our government.  A bunch of old fogies, making rules and regulations that will affect their grandchildren.  They're not in touch with our generation whatsoever.  (This is a topic for another day... I could go on for hours about that.)

The vast majority of people that have issues with gay marriage are people that aren't comfortable in their own skin.  Could be mistreatment from a family member growing up.  Maybe they're just insecure in general.  Trying to be masculine and impress some chick by gay-bashing?  Cool story, bro.

Amen.
