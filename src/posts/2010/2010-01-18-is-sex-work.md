A U.S.M.C. Major was about to start the morning briefing to his staff. While waiting for the coffee machine to finish its brewing, the major decided to pose a question to all assembled. He explained that his wife had been a bit frisky the night before and he failed to get his usual amount of sound sleep.

He posed the question of just how much of sex was "work" and how much of it was "pleasure?"

A Captain chimed in with 75-25% in favor of work.

A Lieutenant said it was 50-50%.

A Sergeant responded with 25-75% in favor of pleasure, depending upon his state of inebriation at the time.

There being no consensus, the major turned to the corporal who was in charge of making the coffee. What was HIS opinion?

Without any hesitation, the young corporal responded, "Sir, it has to be 100% pleasure."

The Major was surprised and, as you might guess, asked why.

"Well, sir, if there was any work involved, the officers would have me doing it for them."

The room fell silent.

God bless the enlisted man.
