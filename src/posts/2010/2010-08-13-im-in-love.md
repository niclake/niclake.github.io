The other day, I tweeted something to the general effect that bringing a new guitar amp home was akin to most families bringing their newborn child home.

I really wasn't joking about that.

A Vox AC30C2.  Cost me a cool grand.  Brand new, I'm the only one to have ever played on this.  Spent about an hour and a half sitting downstairs in the living room (which doesn't currently have any furniture in it... the amp is where the TV is supposed to be) getting it dialed in just how I like.

And damn, it sounds sweet.

Happy half birthday to me. :-)
