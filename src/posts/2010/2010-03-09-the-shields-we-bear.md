I keep looking at the title of this and thinking "panda bear".  Rawr!

![](images/shield_MRP881004.jpg)Every single human being, no matter how "open" they claim to be, is guarded in some form.  Think the knights of olden days.  You'd see some of them walking around with this light leather armor.  Others would have massive plate mail.  Lots of warriors would carry shields to help protect themselves.

Thankfully, modern day isn't nearly as deadly as a Middle Age sword (or is it?  Hrm... maybe that was a poor analogy), so we don't have to carry physical shields around with us day in and day out.  But we do still have the armor and protection with us all the time, in some form.

Over this past weekend, I've been dealing with terrible back pain/spasms.  Never had it happen before, and it just came out of nowhere.  Friday morning, they were so bad that it took me 2 hours to get out of bed just to shut my alarm clock off.

Yeah, it sucked.

The entire weekend, I got a bunch of the "what did you do" questions from people.  Now, I could be boring and lame and tell everyone I don't know what I did, and that would be that.  Boring, I know.  So obviously, I didn't choose that option.  My answers were varied, but here were a couple of them...

- It was a looooooooong night ;-)
- I gave your mom a piggyback ride.
- I got kicked by 30 leprechauns for not having a Guinness while I was at Jameson's (the local Irish pub).
- My tryout for the WWE went poorly.

There were others, but I can't think of them right now.

Truth be told, I really don't know what triggered this.  I've been working out more, so I thought maybe I pulled something.  Who knows.  Regardless, I was in a ton of pain throughout the weekend, and was using (attempted) humor to mask my feelings.

This is a common occurrence for me.  For example:

\- I just turned 23 about a month ago.  I joke along with everyone else that I'm getting "old" and whatnot.  (Hey, maybe this back injury is telling me that I need a walker...)  My joking is covering up the fact that I'm freaked out about being 23, with 2 more years of college in front of me for my undergrad, the fact that all my younger friends are graduating and moving on to bigger and better things, and that I still have no idea what I want to do with my life.

\- My friends constantly tease me about my poor luck with women.  I laugh along with it now, mostly to cover up the fact that I'm still hurting inside.  Not as badly as I once was, but it's still there.

Those are the prime examples that come to my mind.  I'm sure there are others.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with coping, or with deflection.  I'd be willing to bet that most of us go through some form of mechanism like that on a daily basis.  Something minor like an irritating co-worker, to something major like the death of a family member.

Everyone has different modes of deflection.  Some people have self destructive behaviors, like cutting or an eating disorder.  Some people bottle their emotions up.  Some vent.  Me?  I tell jokes and make valiant attempts at humor.  Sometimes it works.  Sometimes it doesn't.  Ok, a lot of times it doesn't.

Next time you're talking with someone, and they seem to have a really odd reaction to a serious subject, look deeper.  Some people don't want to talk about things, but others do.  Or sometimes, they just want you to shut it and not bring that subject up anymore.  No two people are the same, and we will never have the same reactions to things.  Just be observant, and you could potentially provide a lot of help to someone who really needs it.

(Note: I'm fine.  I'm not venting here, especially not in that last paragraph.  I'm just making a point. Don't freak out.)

Also: over here on the right, you'll see an RSS feed called "The Other Stuff".  This will contain all sorts of things that don't fit into a normal tweet, but aren't "big enough" to do a whole blog post about.  Pictures, videos, music, etc.  Enjoy. :-)
