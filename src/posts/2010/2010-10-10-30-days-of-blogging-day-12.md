Thank God I got medicine for my strep throat when I did.  Still feeling like crap, but it's a better crap than it was yesterday.  Analyze that last sentence for more than 10 seconds without thinking of poop, I dare you.

Best part about being sick this weekend: well, it's the weekend.  Not much to do, so just a lot of sitting and relaxing.  Worst part? Mother Nature is still a hormonal bitch, and it's been 75-80 degrees out side the past 2 days.  \*le sigh\*

Day 12: Something you never get compliments on.

Um...

...seriously, I'm drawing a blank here.

Maybe that I'm nice?  But I guess I never get compliments on it because I rarely show it.  I've developed a bit of a tough exterior over the past few years.  Not because I wanted to, mind you... but out of necessity.

Sorry for all these lame posts the past couple days.  The topics get a little better here in the future, so it'll get more entertaining.  Promise. :-)
