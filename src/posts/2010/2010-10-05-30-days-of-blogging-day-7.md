Day 7: Someone who has made your life worth living for.

This is actually a tough question, if I'm trying to avoid all the clich√©s and everything. I could say my parents or all my friends, or I could be emo and all "oh my life isn't worth living" and such. But that's lame. And boring.

Instead, my answer is... **_My friend Enrique_**.

I met Enrique, or Q as we call him, when he was one of the youth leaders at the high school church gathering called Big House here in town. Instantly, I gravitated towards him, both because he seemed like an excellent guy, as well as because he was an incredible guitar player.

Q has helped me through some of the toughest struggles in my life. The messy breakups, the family problems, questions with my religious faith, difficulties when my arm finally gave out and I couldn't play music anymore, and so on. Through it all, he's been both a great friend, as well as an adult that I don't hesitate to turn to for a "more seasoned" opinion.

Today, a lot has changed. Q's now a leadership director at the local church I attend. I'm no longer a punk-y high school student (rather, a snot-nosed college kid). But he's still an awesome guy, and still the best guitar player that I've ever met.
