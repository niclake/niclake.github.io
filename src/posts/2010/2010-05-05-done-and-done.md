This is me, doing a little jig of elation.

Finals are over.  At last.

I had 4 classes (and thus 4 finals) this semester.  Micro Economics went well, and I ended off with a B- in the class.  I made my Business Programming final say "uncle", and think I locked up an A- in that class.  Accounting yesterday was rough... really rough.  The only nice thing about that test was we were given 55 questions, and only 50 would count.  That's 5 free questions.  Plus, 5 extra credit questions (I got at least 4/5 of those), and I only needed to get 37 right in order to maintain a B in that class.  Fingers crossed.

This morning's final was the one I was worried about the most... Business Statistics.  My grade in that class was... not good.  Kinda the same as Micro Economics used to be.  However, I got my ass in gear over this last month, and managed to salvage my grades a little bit.  I was just hoping that I'd do well enough on this test to pull myself into the B range.

I completely dominated that test this morning.

If feelings are anything to go off of, then I got an A.  3 questions I was kinda "meh" over, and 1 that I blindly guessed at because I think it was unsolvable.  Regardless, I expected to get back feeling a little down about the test... instead, I'm stoked.

I'm celebrating.  I'm buying a Mt. Dew right meow.  I think this is my... 8th? pop I've had all year.  I'm holding semi-strong to my resolutions this year (I've only had fast food twice).

Now it's 10 days of summer before I start my internship.  HUZZAH!!!
