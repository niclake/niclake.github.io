March Madness is such a great time of the year.  It ties for my favorite, along with the MLB playoffs, though college basketball wins when/if the Red Sox and Cubs are eliminated, while basketball is awesome from beginning to end.  There's really nothing like the frantic pace of 48 college basketball games in 4 days in a tournament setting.  I love it, and I think we all do, as Americans.  You've got the office pools, the random betting, and the intensity that seems to sweep the nation every year during Spring Break.

Just today, I went to Des Moines with a friend so I could go to an interview.  After that was done, we went to the Jordan Creek Mall to look around and make a visit to the Apple store.  I walk in, and what do I see?  A guy and his son at one of the iMacs, pulling up ESPN in order to check the scores of the early games.

Awesome.

I think the reason why we like the tournament so much can be boiled down to two simple concepts that also define America: competition, and the underdog.

Obviously as Americans, we are all about competition.  Competition is what drives the American commerce, and it's one of the things that makes America one of the greatest nations in the world.  But the underdog... oh man, we love the underdog.  Think small businesses in America.  The friend that I went to Des Moines with [owns his own massage business](http://www.puretranquility.net/) (shameless plug: I'm the web designer).  While I've never actually gotten a massage from him, I've heard that people really appreciate the individual care they receive at his business, rather than the "corporate care" they get from a large chain company.  Or the local burrito shop (Pablos) that we have, over a company like Chipotles or Pancheros (though Panch is definitely delicious).  Or the local farmer's market over your supermarket.  Or any other number of examples that you can think of.

My Final Four consists of 3 #1s and a #2.  Already, that #2 (Villanova) had a scare and almost lost their game.  A 10, 11, and 13 have already scored the upset.  My team (Northern Iowa, a #9) is currently leading by 2 with 15 minutes to go.  And even if I didn't pick some of these teams to win (only missed St. Mary's upsetting Richmond so far), there's nothing that I enjoy more than a good upset.

I will root wholeheartedly for any of these upsets to happen, even if they destroy my bracket.  Gotta root for the little guy, you know?

In other news, that interview I went to... that job would be killer.  120+ applicants.  37 interviewed.  About 10 job openings.  I'd make good money, I wouldn't have to move to Des Moines (which means more money in my pocket), I wouldn't have to pay for food/gas/laundry (also more money).  I'd get to travel all over the tri-state area in either a company car, or a ridiculously-high company reimbursement rate.  In short... I really, really, really want this job. :-P
