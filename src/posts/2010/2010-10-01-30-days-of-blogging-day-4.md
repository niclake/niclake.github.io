Pretty pumped for this weekend. Going to Iowa City to hang out with a couple of friends, participate in the homecoming parade, and watch some Hawkeye football (meh, just in the bars somewhere... tickets are too expensive). Should be a nice mini-vacation.

Unfortunately, there's a particular person that (I believe) lives in Iowa City right now, and I really hope I don't have to run into that person this weekend. Bad things would probably happen. Which leads me to today's topic:

\------------

Day 4: Something you have to forgive someone for.

That person in IC is my ex. "The" ex. I have 4: Awesome, Bitch, Rebound, and Psycho (names obviously withdrawn so I can have more fun making shit up). In this case, we're talking about Bitch. And basically, I need to **_forgive her for crushing my soul_. (As funny/lol-esque as that may sound, I"m being serious here.)**

I guess along the path to forgiveness, I should probably stop calling her Bitch. So we'll call her J instead.

I'm not going to go into the entire story of what happened, because I've probably done that numerous times before on the blog. Brief synopsis though: J and I dated my first 2 years of college. Fell in love. Both of us seemed serious about getting married, and I planned on proposing on our 2 year anniversary. 21 months into the relationship, I discover she'd cheated on me (numerous times, with numerous people) for 14 months of the relationship.

See? Soul crushed.

To say that I was emotionally damaged by how that relationship ended would be an understatement. The breakup happened over 3 years ago, and I"m still picking up the pieces. I'm more cynical about everything. Still suffering from clinical depression. I've gotten over being angry, but I'm sure there's still some pent up rage in there somewhere. A year ago, if I saw her, I'd probably punch her in the face. Now? Well, I still might, but I'd smile while I did it.

But good things came out of that. So J, I should probably thank you for those.

1. I didn't get married to a cheater.
2. I realize now my concept of "love" was greatly skewed. The things I loved about you would've led to a divorce (probably).
3. Due to Depression-Related School Issues (DRSI), I changed my major to something I really enjoy, and away from something I was questionable about.
4. Due to DRSI, I dropped out of school for a while, which allowed me to get a great full-time job and the vital resume padder that has served me so well ever since.
5. I don't have to worry about catching that STD from you. (This made me laugh when I found out. Literally rolling on the floor laughing.)
6. It helped me cement relationships with some of my friends, since I didn't have to divide my time any longer.
7. I don't have to worry about spending money on gas every week to get to Waverly/Iowa City to visit you.

In the long run, I realize that you just didn't think we would work out. And that's cool. But man (woman?) up, and just tell me. You don't have to carry on a facade for over a year. (This goes for both the ladies \*and\* the dudes. Knock that crap off.)

So I forgive you, J. The pros far outweigh the cons from us breaking up. I'll just sit here, taking the (slightly) higher ground, and just point and laugh as you wreck the rest of your life doing dumb things/people.

(That felt pretty good... I should've done that sooner!)
