It's been a few days since I've actually written a post.  School and life have gotten the best of me, and I either don't have time, or just haven't made time to do it.  Even now, I have general writer's block for a massive post.  Instead, I think I'll give you a few tips, tricks, pointers, or just random thoughts that I've had throughout the past few weeks.

1) Finding something to do/give up for Lent when you're already maintaining two New Year's Resolutions is actually kind of difficult.

2) A lot of people participate in Lent for the wrong reasons.  Giving up chocolate, for example... I remember a lot of people in high school doing that one.  The point of Lent is to participate in (or distance yourself from) an activity in order to better focus your mind on God.  When someone does something, like actively preventing themselves from swearing, or reading the Bible in the morning, it actually gives you an opportunity to do that.  Giving up chocolate is more like a miniaturized New Year's Resolution, unless you are someone that eats it every day and can key in on why you're giving it up.

3) I am giving up using my computer for any activity other than checking e-mail before I either a) eat breakfast or b) have my first class of the day.  E-mail for me has the potential to be vital and affect the outcome of my day, so that's why I have allowed it to stay.  No AIM/MSN, no Twitter, and (most importantly) no Facebook.  I will begin my day in peace.  Read.  Do homework.  But most importantly, remember why I'm giving it up.

4) Electric guitars, for the most part, are really solid objects.  Attempting to show it up by headbutting it in the side only leads to pain, bleeding, and a mild concussion.

5) From the time of writing this post, MLB's (and more importantly, the Red Sox's) spring training begins in a day and a half.  I can't tell you how excited I am.

6) ESPN's Streak for the Cash is an extremely difficult game.  Also, some people devote way too much of their lives to making their picks.

7) The vast majority of my friends are going to be gone within a year.  Previously, this lead to me "turtling" in my dorm room, secluding myself and preparing to be alone.  Now, though, it's led me back into contact with old friends, to establish new ones, and to enjoy the time with said current friends while they're still around.

8.) Some of the people I have considered friends for years have recently become outed as the biggest liars on the planet.  I only believed them because I was naive, stupid, and all too trusting.  I will continue to put on a smile while I still have to, but this alone pisses me off.

9) Some people really know how to push my buttons.  One person in particular, if they were writhing on the ground on fire, I wouldn't even have the decency to piss on them to put it out.

10) I'm tired of winter.  The season makes me miserable, for more than one reason.  Go away, please.

11) For Single's Awareness Day (better known as Valentine's Day), I agreed to go out and have a drink with a friend at 7pm.  Said "one drink" turned into several, and I woke up the following morning on someone's couch.  I was really confused.

12) Writing a frequent blog that has no specific goal or outcome, other than to channel my day-to-day thoughts, is actually quite difficult.  To those that can actually pull this off... kudos.

13) I miss my cousins.  I wish I had the time and money to visit 4 of them in particular a lot more frequently than I get to see them now.

14) I miss my dog.  It's been almost a year since she died, and I still can't get over the fact that I expect her to come trotting up to the door, or barking at the doorbell whenever it rings.  Going home sucks for this reason.

15) I wish I hadn't sold my little practice amp 2 years ago.  The desire to have something to play through in the dorms really bothers me.

16) I wish I had a point-and-shoot camera.  I'm a college-aged girl in that regards.  While I don't have any desire to take the standard "MySpace photo" shots, I do miss the ability to capture things I see for future viewing.  The camera on my phone doesn't do the world justice.

17) I have some great readers and great friends, all of whom have given me similar advice on multiple topics.  It's time I stopped being a wuss and actually did what they suggested.

18) Holding myself to both of my New Year's Resolutions is... interesting.  Giving up pop was fairly simple... however, I now drink 2+ liters of water a day, and having to refill all of my bottles all the time is a minor inconvenience.  I have had 2... one on a day I had to wake up and study, and the other on my birthday (this past Saturday) as a treat to myself.  I may have one on Easter as well.  As far as working out, I have recently had the desire strengthened in my mind, and have also found better times to fit my schedule and people to go with.  I think I'm on the right track.

19) Working this 8-midnight shift here at the computer lab is quite possibly the most boring thing I've ever done.  Thank goodness for movies... now I just need more.

20) Even with everything that has happened to me over the past 2 years, the desire to skip class still resides in me.  There are days where just curling up and going back to sleep in my warm bed makes everything better.  As such, I have resolved to move to warmer climates where the temptation won't be quite as strong.  Of course, then I'll meet some lass who makes me smile, and I'll have other temptations preventing me from going.  (Kidding.  .....mostly.)

21) I don't understand Tumblr, nor Google Wave.  Tumblr is like a midget blog, and Wave is just Twitter, only less private.  Can someone explain either of these to me?

22) I realized that I only have 4 requirements for potential dating interests... 1) female.  2) strong woman (independent is a plus).  3) loves music.  4) understands and/or participates in my love of sports.  I'm a simple guy.  Oh, and if you bash Macs too much, we're going to have a problem.

23) I originally had 7 things to write about.  It suddenly bloomed to 20.  My apologies to anyone who read the title and thought my mind was tiny.

24) Last but not least, thanks again to Alex for allowing me to guest blog for him last week.  You may see him poking his head in here in the future, who knows!
