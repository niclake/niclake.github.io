I can't think of much of a better way for this day to start.

I woke up at 10:30 this morning.  My body told me it was only 9:30, but my phone was ringing.  I picked it up, and noticed a) it was my parent's house (aka my mother), and b) my phone was about to die.  So I pushed it to voicemail, plugged my phone in, and called her back.

Mom: "Guess how much you're getting back on your tax returns?"

Me: "Um... I have no idea."

Mom: "Well, your state return is giving you around $100."

... great, thanks Mom.  Is that what you called me for?

Mom: "Oh, you wanna know how much you're getting from the Feds?"

Me: "That'd be super..."

Mom: "Oh, ok, we'll, you're getting about $1,640 from them."

........... WHAT?!?!?!?

Apparently, because of me being in school, I get some massive credits or something.  Or something about being in the Midwest Disaster Area.  I don't know how it works, and that's ok.  I expected MAYBE $600 total.  Not $1,750.  Even though most of that money is going to my parents to pay them back for all the money they've loaned me over the past 2 years, that'll still be a nice sum of money.  No, I have no idea what I'm buying.  Probably just putting it into savings for future purchases.

Also, I have to rant a little bit here.  I'm a huge college basketball fan, and was really excited when Northern Iowa made their 2nd straight NCAA tournament.  We had a pretty awesome team this year, and had high hopes for the Big Dance this year.  However, in the final week, we hit a bit of a stumbling block, losing to Evansville, the last ranked team in the Missouri Valley Conference.

Ouch.

Long story short, we dropped out of the Top 25, there were talks that we might be "on the bubble" and not get in unless we won our conference tournament (which we did, in pretty deciding fashion too), and went from having possibly as high as a 5 seed (which would've been outstanding) to dropping to a 9 seed.  We play UNLV in the first round, and then run smack into the overall #1 seed Kansas.

I'm just upset that we got ranked as a 9.  No way.  People across the nation were projecting us as a 7.  There was still an outside chance for a 6 (which would've been the ideal position, in my mind).  But a 9?  That just sucks.  A tough first-round matchup awaits us, and if we make it past that, then we're going to have an extremely difficult matchup against Kansas.  I don't write us off, since I know we have an outstanding defense, but they are the #1 team for a reason, and UNI would have to have the game of their life in order to make the Sweet 16.  Fingers crossed.

Spring break is nice.  Daylight savings is not.

Things to do this week:

- Work out (now that the doctor has cleared me for exercise again... back spasms)
- Play guitar
- Video games (woo, geeks!)
- Blog.  I've got a couple good ideas.
- Job interview on Thursday in Des Moines.  Have to see if that would be a good summer internship or not.
- Basketball.  After a whole week of conference tournaments, we get a bit of a break before diving into the NCAA tournament on Thursday.  My Final 4 - Kansas, Syracuse, Kentucky, and Villanova.  My pick - Kentucky over Kansas.
- Study.  A little.  Maybe.  It is break after all.

Wow, I still can't get over the fact I'm getting so much on my tax return.  That just made my week.  :-D
