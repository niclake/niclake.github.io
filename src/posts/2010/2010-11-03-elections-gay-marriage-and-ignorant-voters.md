Man, this is \*not\* how I wanted to be writing post #200.  At all.  (Also, apologies for my absence.  I promise to explain myself, and soon.  But for now... on to other topics.)  A pre-emptive "sorry" for the long rant.

And no, I'm not censoring myself in this post.  I'm sorry in advance, but I'm really ticked off about this.

As many of you know (and all of you should have participated in), yesterday was Election Day across the country.  Governors, Senators, House members, and more were all up for election/re-election.  If you went out and voted, regardless of who you nominated or what party you're affiliated with, thank you.  I think across the board, this election really went to show that every person does count.  There were tons of tight races across the country.  Colorado had to wait until this morning to announce one of the winners, it was so close.  **If you didn't vote, I'm ashamed of you**.  Freakin' A, apparently only 10% of the under-26 population in Iowa actually got out and voted yesterday.  What a crock. (EDIT: [Apparently it was only 6% of the under-24 population... wow.](http://d.pr/f8Tv))

**_"But Nic, I don't care!"_** Then I don't want to hear you bitch about anything mildly related to politics until the next election rolls around.  Seriously.

**_"But Nic, I didn't know anything about <insert candidate's name>'s stances or policies!"_** There's this wonderful tool called the internet, and an awesome site called Google.  I suggest you acquaint yourself with it.

**_"But Nic, I'm lazy!"_** Then kindly roll your ass across the border to Mexico or Canada so I don't have to pay taxes to support you when you're eventually on welfare.  Yeah, I said it.<!--more-->

I hate politics.  Really, I do.  You take a popularity contest from junior high, add more major transgressions other than "Timmy kissed Susie behind the bleachers!" (nowadays, they go to Columbia or something), and throw in a ton of wasted money on these stupid campaigns.  But damnit, the blatant stupidity of some people is just disgusting.

For example... recently, you may remember how Iowa became one of the nation's first states to legalize gay marriage.  I've spoken about this before on the blog; I'm not necessarily pro- or anti-gay marriage, but I \*am\* pro-civil rights for everyone.  So long as marriage is something that's authorized and overseen by the national government (for tax purposes and beyond), any American citizen should be able to marry any other American citizen of legal age.  Man/woman?  Man/man?  Woman/woman?  Go for it.  If the government decide that they want to authorize "civil unions", and classify "marriage" as a type of "civil union", then people can start the debate again.

And yet, I still don't think that would settle the issue.  So many people in America are blatant homophobes that it wouldn't matter if we had "marriage" and "kerfuffles" (or whatever they decided to name civil unions between non-heterosexual couples).  **They'd still bitch about it, even though it had absolutely zero effect on their lives whatsoever**.  You know I'm right.

But that's not the issue here.  The issue is the following:

The reason Iowa allows gay marriages is because, once upon a time, this matter was brought up to the Supreme Court of Iowa.  Our justices looked at the matter, looked at the way the laws had been written (notice I make no mention here of re-writing, only reading), and decide that it is not fair and just to prevent gays from marrying each other.  As such, Iowa allowed these unions.  And the people rejoiced (yay!).  Well, some people did.

On Tuesday, the 3  justices in the Iowa Supreme Court that were up for reelection were voted out of office.  While I don't have my sources, I do believe I read somewhere that this is the first time in Iowa's history that justices have been voted out of office.  The group "Iowa for Freedom" (Google them yourselves, I refuse to link to their filth) declared our justices "tyrants", "activists", and "radicals", claiming that they were abusing their power when they made the decision to make Iowa a "Same Sex" marriage state.  To me, the entire concept of their campaign (to which most of the funding/backing came from out of state) seems, again, homophobic and anti-civil rights to me.

On top of that, there was the following conversation a friend and I had via his Facebook wall.  (Quick background: this guy is going to school to be a teacher.)

> **Friend: to say people that voted out the judges only bc of their ruling is wrong bc i voted no just bc i could and its nice for other people to have a turn lol**
> 
> _Me: When teachers start being put up for election, even if you're doing a fantastic job, I'm going to vote you out just so some other teacher can have a turn._
> 
> **Friend: if there is a supreme court justice for teachers and they make rulings that effect everyone then go for it nic... I think it is somewhat dangerous to let someone have a lot of power for too long... just as the president can only serve two terms**
> 
> _Me: First, I was using that as an analogy._
> 
> _Second, that's usually what supreme court justices do. They're looking at the law, and making a ruling that can be referenced and utilized at a later date. So, indirectly, their daily jobs involve them making rulings that affect everyone._
> 
> _Third, the only reason anyone was unhappy with the justices was a direct result of their direct interpretation of the law in regards to gay marriage. If the justices were "being dangerous" or "too powerful", they would've made a decision totally based on judgement. Instead, they took the laws regulations that had been established and laid down previously, decided "yeah, those make sense, why should we change them?", and put those into motion._
> 
> _They did their jobs. They did nothing wrong. Stating "well everyone should get a turn" is NOT what democracy is about, and is an extremely simplistic and childish point of view to have._

_For whatever reason, I got really, REALLY upset about this conversation.  I'm not a confrontational guy... hell, I'm not even a political guy... but this got me fired up._

_Eventually, we're going to have another civil rights movement on the scale of 50s and 60s, only this time it will be about gay rights rather than the rights of blacks and other minorities._ _"I'm not homophobic, I just don't think gay people should be allowed to partake in the same civil unions as me." is akin to saying "I'm not racist, I just don't think blacks should be allowed to ride on my bus."  Sound familiar?_

_Look, to some degree, I'm ok with what happened yesterday.  Democracy truly is about what the people want (for the most part), and as such, I have to live with the results because in this case, I'm in the minority.  But the frustrating thing in all of this are the people who either walk in completely ignorant of the issues, voting blindly or on some wild and random method, or people that don't research and just go into the polls with a narrow viewpoint or a single-minded goal to "get this one guy I hate out of office".  You dumbasses._

_Please, everyone... **go vote**.  But before you do, do yourselves and the rest of America a favor and **educate yourselves**.  Educate yourselves on the issues and stances that are covered not only by your candidate of choice, but also those of their opponents.  Don't vote just because you don't like someone.  Vote because you don't like specific views a, b, and c of candidate X, and you feel that your views and views a, b, and c of candidate Z over here are more aligned._

_Also... seriously, America.  Why can't we get the results faster than this?  I can get my 100-question multiple choice test graded in < 5 seconds, but you're telling me it takes you until this morning to completely finish going over all of the ballots?  Let's fix this..._

_I'm done talking about politics for a while._
