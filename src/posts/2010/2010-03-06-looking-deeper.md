Someone suggested the other day that I should write about some of the more intimate aspects of my life.  Since I've been single for oh-so-long, I'm assuming they didn't mean \*that\* kind of intimate, but rather more of the personal things that go on in my life.  As such, I've decided to write about a few of them.  I may update every once in a while if I think of a more.

1) **I'm afraid of the dark.** It's true.  Not the dark like when you turn off the lights and go to bed, but when you're walking around a house or something and it's pitch black.  While it has its roots in irrational fears, the modern day iteration of this is actually very logical.  My friend Jordan's house gets extremely dark after sundown, and they don't have any sort of glow in the downstairs portion.  Thus, if we ever come back to an empty house late at night, someone's gotta trek through a narrow path to get to the light switch.  I've nailed my shins on their coffee table more than once.

Oh, and the irrational fear?  My parent's house gets really dark too, and sometimes I'd forget to turn on the stairway light before going upstairs.  As such, late at night, (don't laugh) I used to be afraid that there was an owl waiting to swoop at me from the end of the upstairs hallway.  Kids, huh?

2) **I miss my dog.  A lot.** Honestly, I hate going home to my parent's house because of it.  We got my dog when I was in 5th grade.  A little Shih-tzu (pronounced Shit Zoo) that couldn't climb over my ankles, she was so tiny.  She'd chase me to the stairs when I was going up, be waiting at the door when we came home, bark at my mom's piano students, and clean up any food we happened to drop.  My dad was really the one that did all the work with her, but it still sucked when she died.  My parents and I came back from eating my birthday dinner a couple weeks ago, and as I unlocked the back door, I was waiting for her to be waiting there for us.  No go.

Maybe that's why I want another pet so bad...

3) **I have perfect pitch.** Or absolute pitch, whatever you want to call it.  This is different than relative pitch, which many musicians can train.  Relative pitch relies on some sort of outward stimulus, be it a tuning fork/whistle, note of a song, or something similar, in order to find some musical note.  Perfect pitch needs no outward stimulus to do so.

Having PP is both a curse and a blessing.  Without it, I'm certain that I wouldn't be near the musician that I am today.  For guitar playing, I rarely look at tabs or music, but rather just learn the parts based off of what I hear on recordings.  Having 13 years of classical piano training probably doesn't hurt either.  However, it's a curse because it affects me pretty much every day of my life.  My high school's buzzer/bell was a slightly-flat Eb.  13 times a day, I heard it go off, and it would make me cringe.  At concerts, I'll lean to the person next to me and say something like "that guitarist's D-string is flat".  The song I'm listening to right now is in C-minor.  In one particular song on Dream Theater's "Score" DVD, I have to fast forward through the first part of the verse because the singer absolutely butchers his part.  Things like that.

The positives far outweigh the negatives, though.  I wouldn't give it up for anything.

4) **I have a very, very weird memory.** Seriously.  I have the worst short term memory in the world, in part due to the fact that my mind is always going a million miles a minute.  It definitely lends towards assisting the creative aspects in my life, but if I'm not focused on something, or if I don't have a method of writing my thoughts down, then any thought is usually gone in less than 15 seconds.  It's extremely frustrating.

By the same token, my long-term memory is like a steel trap.  I am especially good with dates and numbers.  May 5.  October 10.  September 15.  June 24.  All of those are important dates in my life in some way or another.  I can also remember the phone numbers of my 2 best friends growing up, the number of the local Chinese delivery, and a whole slew of others.  I don't put them into my cell phone because it's honestly much easier for me to just dial them from memory.

I may come up with more as time comes along, but for now, that's what I could think of.  Enjoy. :-)
