I haven't gone to a concert in a long, long time.  Actually, I can tell you when it was... January 10, 2007.  1,191 days.  I went with my ex to see The Fray (yes, I know) at Wartburg College.  Best part of the evening: realizing that the opening act, Mutemath, was waaaaaaaaay better than The Fray.  Mutemath is still one of my favorite bands to this day.

Some friends have wanted me to go see Paramore/Relient K... [as gorgeous as I think Hayley is](http://blog.ymijeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/hayley-williams.jpg), a concert like that just really isn't my thing.  I really wanted to go to Lollapalooza this year, but a) I'll be working and b) there's only 2 bands (Phoenix and Mutemath) that I really want to see.

Buuuuuuuuuut... I just found out that on May 13th, Coheed & Cambria, along with Circa Survive, will be playing in Minneapolis.

And I really, really, REALLY want to go.

Anyone else interested?!?
