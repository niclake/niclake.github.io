With 11 full days of 2010 left, it's high time to start thinking about what you'd like to do for your New Year's Resolution.  I had pretty solid success with my eating healthy/giving up pop resolutions (they're more guidelines than anything), and will probably do that one again this year.  I know a lot of college students resolve to start working out more, which leads to our wellness center being jam packed for the first 2 weeks after school returns.

Lately, I've thought of a few things that aren't necessarily resolutions, but are more just things that I'd like to do at some point in my life.  So here goes...

1) **Learn an accent** - I'd love love LOOOOOVE to learn an accent.  There's so many advantages to that.  I could pretend that I'm not from Iowa.  I could pick up chicks.  I could feel more distinguished.  All sorts of possible scenarios.  My friend Julie has a hilarious (but good) Russian accent that she talked in for a while at a party this weekend, and it made me think "dang, I should learn one".  My targets?  Boston, southern, or British.

2) **Travel overseas** - I have to go, sometime.  England/France/Spain/anywhere in Europe, China, Japan... somewhere.  I want to go, and that's all there is to it.

3) **Write a book and have it published** - I go in kicks where I write a lot.  Then I go in kicks where I don't write at all.  Some day, part of me wishes that I could sit down and write out a book that gets published.  What kind of book?  I have no idea.  Maybe I'll get lucky like J.K Rowling and become uber-rich because of it.

4) **Own an ugly Christmas sweater** - I always feel out of place during this time of year, simply because I don't have a Christmas sweater of any variety, much less an ugly one.  I show up to parties feeling overdressed with my t-shirt and jeans.  I must fix this.

5) **Win a fist fight** - I've been in 3 fights in my life, and won them all.  I punched Mitch Damgaard in the nose in kindergarten because he stole my coat hanger spot.  I got a couple great shots in on Victor Mujica in jr. high after he took a swipe at my head over a basketball court misunderstanding.  And freshman year of college, I dropped some drunk guy that wanted to start a fracas.  But I wanna be able to say that I've gone toe to toe with a guy and beaten him fair and square (even though each of those people were bigger than me at the time).  But don't touch my face, bro.  I got a pretty face, and I don't want it messed up. #honkhonk

(P.S. for those that don't know, #honkhonk is my new Twitter thing to indicate the Sarcasm Horn.  Respond appropriately.)
