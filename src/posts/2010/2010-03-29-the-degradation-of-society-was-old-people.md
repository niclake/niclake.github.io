Have you ever realized how freakin' cool old people are?

Whoh, wait, back up.  First of all.  Old people, for the duration of this blog post, are hence forth known as "those humans who are of at least the age of 67 years or beyond".  K?  K.

Have you ever realized how freakin' cool old people are?  I had that revelation just last night.  No, nothing really prompted me thinking about it, it just kinda popped into my head.  And, since I didn't really have anything to write about today, I decided to run with it and make my thoughts into a whole blog post.

Think about it.  When we're, what, anywhere from grade school all the way up till our 60's (50's?  I haven't gotten there yet, so I'm not sure), everything in life is about succeeding and about appearances.  In school, we're always told to strive for good grades by our teachers and parents.  Most of us also try to be "cool" and fit in with our friends.  This could involve anything from ditching class to buying the latest "hip" device, whatever that may be.  I distinctly remember how "awesome" yo-yo's were when I was in 6th grade.  Yo-yo's and Game Boys.  If you were a 6th grade boy in Mrs. Bohr's class, and you didn't have a yo-yo or a Game Boy, you were "not cool".  That's just how it was.  We all desired to fit in with everyone, and we wanted it so badly that we'd beg our parents to buy us something that we'd utilize for a few weeks, maybe a couple months at most, and then they'd sit in a box or on a shelf somewhere.  My yo-yos (plural, yes.  I think I had 6 or so) are all up in my attic in a box somewhere.

Even when we get older, it's the same deal.  You don't want to be the kid with the outdated laptop, the business pro with a junker car, the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ with the worst/oldest \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  Some vintage stuff is "hip", "cool", or "in style", but for the most part, all of our technology nowadays has increased at such a rapid rate that you really need to keep up in order to succeed or be effective.

And then we get to the "old people".  And frankly, the opinions that old people have in general about all that stuff can be summed up with simple 6-word phrase...

They just don't give a shit.

Seriously.  They don't.

When's the last time you saw Grandma and Grandpa out shopping for the hippest new fashions?  What about your friendly lady in the nursing home that just had to have the new iPhone, in order to be the hippest lady in the entire joint?  Last time you saw that old dude on the corner with a faux-hawk?

Yeah, I didn't think so.

When's the last time and elderly person censored themselves in front of you (except when children were present)?  I'm not just talking about cursing, but about anything.  [I talked in my last blog post](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/gen-y/) about how people really need to be more educated about things, and have opinions that can be based on fact rather than just opinion.  Well, ladies and gents, old people got that stuff on lock-down.  You ask any elderly person about their opinion on Reagan, and you're going to get a strong answer leaning one way or the other.  No waffling.  They'll tell you what's up, and they'll tell you why they think that.  Or about the music of today's generation, or the kids these days and their "crazy Pokemon video games!" or the like.

Asking the opinions of the elderly is akin to drinking an entire bottle of vodka in one evening.  It may have seemed like a fun idea at the time, but you're gonna regret it later.

They get it, guys.  They really do.  And it's not just about appearances or technology and stuff like that... it's life in general.  They really just plain get it.

The older we get, the less and less we care about what other people think of us.  I look at my grandparents, who are going to come and visit over Easter (quite possibly the last trip across the state that they're going to make), and their lives.  They're both highly opinionated people, and they don't hesitate to tell their daughters or grandchildren exactly what they think about something.  They have their group of friends in their hometown.  They live a relatively sheltered life, since it's hard for my grandma to get around now.  Grandpa goes swimming (every day? every other day? I'm not sure), not because he wants to "get buff and woo the ladies", but to keep himself in shape so that he can take care of Grandma.  They have basic cable TV.  They read the newspaper.  They listen to the radio (Grandpa still loves his Twins baseball, and I still love giving him crap about it every time we talk).  They don't go out to eat very often, preferring to fix their food by themselves.  And to this day, they're still the nicest people that I know.

My other grandparents, though I never really knew them as well, were the same way.  Simple living, enjoying life the way it was meant to be.

Nowadays, we as a society escape into our technology and into our own little worlds, and we seem to rarely venture out of them.  I'm just as much at fault for this as the next guy/gal, I'll admit.  I've spent the entire 4 hours that I've been at work listening to my iPod, working on homework (like a good student), surfing the web, and writing this blog.  I have a little 3 foot bubble here at my desk that is pretty much impenetrable by anyone else, unless "anyone else" happens to be a cute female (priorities, people).

Actually, now that I think about it, I know exactly what prompted these thoughts, and why I'm writing my blog post.  Last night at 8:30, people across the nation (world?) participated in Earth Hour, in which we unplugged/shut off any non-necessary electronic device in order to free Willy take a little bit of wear and tear away from the planet.  As I sat there, my room lights off, my computer dark, watching a little bit of TV (yeah, I know... I escaped as much as I could), I just thought "huh, this is what old people do all the time.  They don't have all the distractions that we do.  Maybe a TV or their paper, but that's about it."

It's humbling to think about.  They survived all that time on the bare necessities, and here I'm stressing about missing baseball or the World Cup this year because I'll be on the road all the time for my internship.

Sad, I know.

And I just realized that this post took a whole different direction than I'd originally intended.  But you know what?  I'm ok with that.

I know that a lot of my readers are tech-savvy youngin's like myself.  Do yourself a favor... stand up from the computer.  Call up a friend.  Go hang out.  Grab a baseball or football and play catch.  Get out a board game.  Girls, do whatever it is that you do when you're just hanging out (braid hair?  Barbies?  "Who's-The-Hottest-Guy"?  I really have no idea).

Humans are social creatures, and putting up our technology shields is destroying that completely.  Let's put a stop to it.

.... Sup?  Wanna hang out?
