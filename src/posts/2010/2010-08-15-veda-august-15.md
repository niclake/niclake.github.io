I cheated.

Since I already talked about hangovers (and how I've never gotten one), I decided instead that I would take you to church with me.  Since I'm assuming a lot of the VEDA people that were hanging out online for [#winetoreach](http://twitter.com/#search?q=winetoreach) probably had a bit of a hangover, and weren't gonna make it there, this seemed like a good idea.

And zomg new guitar amp.  EXCITED!!!!!!  (For the record... it sounds amazing.  Better than I expected, and I expected a lot.)

Anyway, it was good hanging out with everyone last night, and I hope you enjoy today's video.
