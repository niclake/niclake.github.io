Day 6: Something you hope you never have to do.

![](images/MarineSniper1.jpg)I remember back when I graduated from high school, and how I was considering going into the Marines. Silly me... that would've been a seriously stupid idea. My thoughts were that I would have been either in recon, a scout sniper, or flown (drive) a helicopter.

Somewhere, In my mind, I have this repressed thought that I'm a total badass. Maybe I just need a tribal armband tattoo...

Anyway, I'm really glad I didn't make that life decision, because it would have put me in situations in which I might have to do something I never want to have to do... **_Kill someone_**.

There are cheating answers, like "losing a kid", "kicking myself in the nuts", "root for the Yankees", and so forth. But killing someone, even in self defense... that's something you live with the rest of your life. Ugh. What a crappy thing to have to think about. (I guess by that reasoning, "rooting for the Yankees" could feasibly work itself into this conversation...)

I feel like I'm cheating on these... I could totally make longer posts. Â But then y'all wouldn't read them... I hate tossups.
