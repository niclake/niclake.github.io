Wow, it's been a while since I've updated.  Life's gotten really busy, sorry.

For those that don't know (which, if you've been reading the blog, you've gotta know by now... c'mon), I'm down in Des Moines working at the MIS (Management Information Systems) internship for Hy-Vee.  So far, the job has been incredible.

First of all, we're being put up in Candlewood Suites.  These rooms are absolutely amazing... there's no reason that interns should rate accommodations like this, but I'm not really complaining.  (Their "high speed" internet is actually running through the phone line, but it's better than nothing I guess.)  I've managed to stay current with all my sports too, so that's nice.

The guys (and gals) that I work with are great.  There's a group of about 8-10 of us that work really well together, and it's made the monotonous work that we've done so far pretty manageable.  Add to that the fact that Hy-Vee is reimbursing us a set amount for every meal, and it's a pretty good time.  (At Perkins, about the only thing we can get that's under our budget is the Buttermilk 5... 5 delicious, pretty good sized pancakes... om nom nom!)  Pancheros, Hy-Vee, Buffalo Wild Wings, Texas Roadhouse, Subway, Perkins... and of course, Starbucks for breakfast.  Love it.

Downside of the gig: We're working in an old Hy-Vee (one that's right next door to the new one they replaced it with).  It's dirty, there's no A/C, and not nearly enough power to support all the computers and servers that we're setting up.  My bed is extremely firm, which I don't like.  I think my car is leaking antifreeze out of the head gasket, which could be a huge problem if I don't get it fixed ASAP.  As mentioned above, this high speed internet is anything but.  And this weather right now is REALLY humid... ugh.

I come from a city of about 30,000 people, and even though I'm living in a hotel, I'm really diggin' the "big city" life (DSM metro area is ~600,000).  I wish I had more time/energy to get out and actually enjoy the Des Moines night life a little... perhaps towards the end of this week, I'll try and get some people together and head out.  I'm praying for less humid (and not stormy) weather too, since a lot of us would like to get out and play some disc golf.

Also... The Lazer 103.3 blows Rock 108 out of the water.  They manage to blend a nice mix of not-crappy modern rock with some great classic rock.  Started my first 2 days last week with Twisted Sister and Pink Floyd.  Yes, yes, and more yes.

I'm not exactly sure what I'll write about this summer, but hopefully I'll keep some fairly regular updates to keep you all entertained.  If nothing else, I'm collecting a nice list of things to write about on the weekends/when I have free time.
