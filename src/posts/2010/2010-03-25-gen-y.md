![](images/071005_consumerforum_bruce-temkin_edited_v3.jpg)I'm sitting in a coffee shop right now.  Thus, it only feels natural that I write a blog post.  You know, that whole "edgy Gen Y" vibe that I have to display.  Except I'm on my PC laptop... fuuuuuu...

I feel really guilty wanting to be a lazy college student some days.  With as much money as I'm spending (or am going to spend in the next 2 years), I feel really bad when I go and try to plan out my schedule for the rest of my time here.  After changing majors a whole bunch and being here for 4 years now, I have 2 gen ed's, a capstone, and then all my major classes left to take.

This could potentially be really, really bad for me.

Obviously, I don't want to over-work myself.  I'm striving for good grades, and loading up on difficult classes all in one semester is definitely not the way to go.  However, that's pretty much what the remainder of my time here at the university is looking like.  19 classes to take in 4 semesters.  16 of those are "major" classes.  5 this fall, 4 the following semester, and 3 each my final 2 semesters.

Kids, let this be a lesson to you.  Spread your gen eds out.  Your sanity will thank you later.

My professor was telling me yesterday about an opportunity that Management Information Systems majors can take, in which we take 2 electives classes and are granted a certificate from the Computer Science department.  I'm sure it could be useful to me, and the classes (especially for MIS majors and/or former CS majors) would be laughably easy.  I contemplated it for a while, even finding out that one of the teachers that I enjoy is the one that teaches those classes.  Then I realized that I'd have a heavier course load than desire (somewhat easy vs. laughably easy), and I said "screw it".  Who knows, maybe I'll be less lazy and take it.

Oh hey... something that's bugging me.  I'm not really a political person.  I'm a left-leaning independent that's currently a registered Democrat, for those that care.  I caucused for Obama, and I voted for him too.  K?  K.  Anyway... what really annoys me is people, regardless of political preference, having an opinion on something that the government does without any information on backing it up.  We got into the whole war in Iraq thing because of the "supposed WMDs" that they had.  Oops.  A lot of people right now are all up in arms about the new health care bill that's being put into place, because they a) refuse to actually learn about what it is and thus try to use their ignorance as both a weapon and a shield, or b) can't look outside of their own personal bubble to see the benefits that this bill could potentially have for millions of Americans.

I look at the Gen Y characteristics above, and I see #5 and 8.  I don't think that this is just Gen Y people, but rather Americans as a whole.  We always seek the recognition of others, preferring to have them shower us in praise rather than to seek it from ourselves.  We also don't really read for content, but instead just for what we truly desire to discover.  You want to find where taxes will probably increase as a result of the health care bill?  You'll find it.  What about drawing a correlation from the bill that points towards Obama being a socialist?  Yeah, I'm sure you can find that too.  Hell, I'm sure you could draw [just about any correlation that you wanted out of this whole health care debate](http://news.yahoo.com/s/dailybeast/20100323/ts_dailybeast/7269_scarynewgoppoll).

**_"Ignorance breeds monsters to fill up the vacancies of the soul that are unoccupied by the verities of knowledge." - Horace Mann_** I don't think I could've found a better quote for the situation.

I don't care if you have an opinion on something.  That's everyone's right.  Whether it's over politics, religion, sports, computers, or even what the best flavor of ice cream is (cookie dough!!!), each and every one of us has the right to our own opinions and beliefs.  And you're more than welcome to share them with people if you wish... but be prepared.  Can you defend your position?  Or are you just repeating random snippets and sound bytes that you heard to help you out?  Cause if it's the latter... any number of my friends (and opinionated/educated people around the world) will put you in your place.  Count on it.

Quote of the day: John (after I looked up a phone number): "I'm impressed with your phone number-getting skills."  Me: "I wish I had phone number-getting skills, 'cause then I'd be a lot less single."  John: \*laughing\* "That implies that there are varying degrees of single-ness."  (It was funnier if you were there.)
