[![](http://rootsandrings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/rr10tuesday.jpg?w=125&h=125&h=125)](http://rootsandrings.wordpress.com/)**1.  If you could travel back in time, would you?  What decade would you visit?** Wow, that's a tough question.  I don't think I would travel in time at all... mostly because I couldn't really decide when to go, or where, or why.

**2. What was your best Halloween costume?  (fun to make? most creative?)** I was never big on costumes, as far as I can recall.  Personally, the most fun I had was when I "scarecrow'd" myself and sat out in front of my house selling candy.  Boots, snowpants, a jacket, gloves and an alien mask, with leaves sticking out of strategically placed locations to make people think I wasn't real.  I remember scaring the piss out of 2 kids when they went to ring the doorbell and I got up and snuck up behind them.  It was awesome.

**3. Do you like your name?  If you weren’t called by your name, what would you want to be called?** It's different, that's for sure.  It's frustrating when people are so lethargic that they don't care how it's spelled... I get "Nick" a lot in e-mails and stuff.  If it persists, I intentionally spell their name wrong.  That usually gets the point across.  Now some people are calling me JJ (it's my middle initial... I don't know how it stuck)... whatever.

Oh, as an aside... for anyone that watched the NCAA tournament this year, Ali Farokhmanesh (guard for Northern Iowa, [noted for taking out Kansas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiwqEz50ipY)) just walked into my computer lab.  Seriously one of the nicest guys I've ever met.

**4. In the past year, what is the BEST recipe you made.  Please share it!** I make some mean chili, and the recipe that I prepared for family Christmas this year was pretty damn good.  I can't tell you exactly what's in it, mostly because the list is at my parent's house.  Lots of spices though.

**5. Look around – what is the nearest object or picture hanging on the wall?** The only things hanging on my wall in my room are 2 signs supporting my favorite teams, the Vikings and the Red Sox.

**6. What was the last movie you saw in a theater?  Would you recommend it?** Last movie I saw was Avatar.  Absolutely incredible.  The visuals absolutely blew my mind.

**7. Did you go to summer camp?  Will you/do you send your kids to camp?** Went to a church camp one summer when I was younger... actually 2 summers, to 2 different camps.  After that, it was Cub Scout/Boy Scout camp for me.  Tons of good memories from that.  If it's appealing to my kids, I will definitely send them to camps.  Give them the opportunities they want, right?

**8. What kind of ringtone do you have?** It's a pretty standard one.  On my old phone, I used to have custom ringtones, but ever since I switched to Sprint I haven't had the desire to buy the SD card needed to store them on.  One ring for if someone's in my phone book, and one if it's a random/blocked number.

**9. Where is the farthest away from home you have ever been?** Florida, when I went for band and choir trips.  I've also been to Mexico, Canada (just across the border) and Montana.

**10. Has anyone ever written a song or a poem for or about you?** Poems, yeah.  Both of my ex's did that on at least one occasion, if I recall correctly.  Definitely a nice gesture. :-)
