It's 4:36 as I start writing this blog post.  This is honestly one of the first times since the semester started that I've been able to just sit back and chill for a bit.  I'm sitting here at work right now, having just finished my Accounting homework for tomorrow.  This weekend is going to be jam packed.  This cute redhead keeps looking over at me.  I still have more stuff to do tonight.  But right now, I just need a chance to mellow out and write.

![](images/relax.jpg)Classes are rough.  Not hard, just busy.  I dropped Philosophy today, leaving me with my 4 business classes.  Philo was going to single-handedly undermine all of my efforts to be successful this semester by requiring me to read a bunch of stuff that I've already read a million times (Plato, J.S. Mill, etc) and do daily worksheets over it.  No thank you.  I was only taking it in effort to boost my GPA a little bit, but I have a bunch of open slots (ok, just 4) between now and when I graduate that I could always fit it in.  I thought my mom would be upset by me dropping, but she was surprisingly chill.  Thumbs up.

A quick notice for everyone in the music circles around the Cedar Falls area.  Be on the lookout for a Fender 40th Anniversary Stratocaster, sunburst color, with a lace sensor pickup in the bridge position.  This was stolen this past week from the church I play at, and needless to say, the owner would really appreciate having it back.  Also, if I catch the person that stole it, some very un-Christian-like philosophies might be introduced to your dome.  Just sayin'.

I'm selling my Playstation 3.  I think.  I haven't touched it since finals week last semester... actually, Jordan was the last person to play it.  Weird.  I'm too busy studying or watching sports... plus, I can't really afford any new games (if any would come out... yeesh.  If I still had an Xbox 360, this would be a different story...).  Anyway, if you know someone who's interested, drop me a line (my info is in my About Me page).

Linux is gone.  Forever.  I got tired of playing around with it, when I honestly had no practical use for it.  I have now installed Windows 7 on my secondary laptop (as well as on a partition on my iMac).  My initial thoughts:

- I still prefer Macs.
- That being said... Windows 7 is very nice.  I had gotten used to the simplistic approach XP had utilized over the years, so this switch to the "elegance" of 7 is odd.  But it's quick, seamless, eye-pleasing ([the awesome gnome background is still there](http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2009/02/25/gnome)), and it does what I need it to do.
- I have learned very quickly how Windows-stupid I am.  You tell me you want something done on a Mac, I do it.  On Windows, I find myself scrambling for Google or advice from my friends on the route I should take.  This just adds to my stress level I've had as of late.

I saw Avatar in theatres about a week ago.  I wish I'd gone to see it in 3D, but even 2D was still amazing.  The story was relatively compelling, but the visual assault was just overwhelming.  A key aspect a lot of people missed out on was the auditory aspects of the film... Most of Pandora (the planet) has its own soundtrack that is playing pretty much constantly, with the various themes and motifs of the characters and settings intertwining with them.  It's pretty amazing when you think about it.

It's now 5:36, and I'm still not done writing this.  In the meantime, I've gotten kicked out of work (or replaced by the 5:00 guy) and gotten dinner.  I figure I'll give myself a break until 6:30 or so, and then it's back to the grind.  Probably pull out Last.FM and try to find some good new music while I'm at it... I got sick of Pandora's advertisements and limit on listening, plus the fact that I haven't heard something new on there in a few months.  You should check it out.
