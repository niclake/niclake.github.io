At the request of a few people on 20 Something Bloggers, I've decided to document my one and only "official" (i.e. not speeding-related) run-in with the police.  Unfortunately, that run-in was this past weekend... haha.  Oops.

Mom, don't freak out.  K?  K.

First of all, let me just say that I'm really disappointed that I didn't have either a box of donuts or a package of bacon handy.  However, that disappointment is quashed by the fact that I stayed out of handcuffs.  Woo!

To properly describe this, I need to go back about a week...

The weekend before last (the 20th?), I was hanging out with some friends, and we decided to go to the bars downtown.  We had already consumed a couple of drinks, so we decided to walk about a mile.  Through a really poorly maintained section of town.  In Iowa.  In February.  It was cold, icy, and 95% of the sidewalks were not properly maintained by the residents.  Oh well, it was fun nonetheless.

Anyway, we closed the bar down and started walking back at about 1:45am.  On the way, a certain female in the group (who I was quite enamored with at the time... funny how things change) decided to pick up a traffic cone and bring it with us.  Now, this wasn't your average, normal sized cone.  No, this was one of the larger, heavier variety, complete with reflective tape wrapped around it.  Not sure what it was blocking/drawing attention to... hopefully nothing too serious.  Anyway, after walking about 15 feet, said female decided the cone was too heavy and dropped it.  Me, being the chivalrous gentleman that I am, decided to pick up the cone and carry it the remained of the mile or so we had left to go.  I know, I'm such a swell guy.  Upon returning to the apartment, I decided to throw the cone in the backseat of my parked car, to get it out of the way.

Fast forward to this past weekend.  We're out at the same bar, only this time I haven't had anything to drink, so I offer to drive everyone downtown instead of walking there.  After listening to an [amazing cover band](http://www.myspace.com/waggmusic) perform for a while, the others decided to head over to one of the more dance-centered bars, and I decided to head home (since I'm not much of a dancer).

Now, I need to state... I'm of the legal drinking age (23), I've actually put on weight from working out lately (194), and I had three (3) beers over the span of about two (2) hours, and had let them "digest" for about forty-five (45) minutes before we even left the bar.  I also routinely drink things harder than beer (when I choose to drink), which has actually upped my beer tolerance (damn you Drew, Katie, and Jake for getting me started on beer... ugh).  I was feeling good, was not stumbling or anything.  Trust me, I could have just walked back to the apartment and slept on the couch instead of going home, if I felt that I was impaired in any sort of way.  I wasn't, so I drove.

Instead of taking my normal route home, I decided to drive a different way, one that would take me closer to my parent's house.  Why?  I don't know.  Anyway, on the drive home, I looked in my mirror and realized there was a car tailgating me (on a 25mph road, mind you).  Instantly assumed it was a cop.  I wasn't weaving, my lights were on, nothing was wrong, so I just assumed it was one of those cases where they'd follow someone and wait for you to screw up.

So I pulled over, not even 2 blocks from my parent's house (which beats the time I got pulled over a block from their house when I was 17... more on that in a second).  The "hot cop" (blonde, mid-30s, somewhat attractive) comes up to my window, asks for all my papers and such.

Come to find out, the registration sticker on my license plate wasn't current.  On the car I'd just acquired from my parents about 4-5 months ago.

Oh, and the papers in my glove box were out of date too.

So she checked the records and everything with the system, found everything was good, and gave me the stuff back, telling me to "get that fixed ASAP". ("Yes ma'am!")  Then, as a routine check, she shines her window in the backseat of my car.

"You mind telling me why there's a traffic cone in your backseat?"

Shit.

I explained the story of the traffic cone in a manner that shed at least some good light on me (friends left it in the street, so I put it in my car to get it out of the way, and hadn't brought it back to public safety because I was busy w/ college).  She ended off confiscating the cone, then asking if I'd had anything to drink.  I told her yes, that I had 3, and had waited before driving.

"Sir, could you step out of the car please?"

Double shit.

She gives me a full sobriety test... I blew under the legal limit, walked perfectly straight, found my nose ok, and recited the alphabet like I was in 1st grade. (Side note... LMNO Peas would be a terrific brand name for some vegetable company.)  I was told to go "home" (being the dorms in town) and get my registration fixed as soon as I could.

Deep sigh of relief.

My other interactions with the police:

- Speeding ticket visiting girlfriend in Waverly.
- Speeding ticket visiting girlfriend in Minnesota.
- Near speeding ticket visiting girlfriend in Waverly (she was distressed, and the cop understood and let me go).
- Near speeding ticket driving home when I was 17 (the one where I was a block from my house, and almost missing curfew).
- Another evening at a friend's house, we were sitting around a fire pit.  I decided to get up and go inside, and for some reason, they started singing "Ole, ole ole ole!" at the top of their lungs.  I danced for a bit, then went inside.  About 15 seconds later, the cops showed up and yelled at my friends.

Needless to say, I'm on the down low for the next couple of weeks. :-P
