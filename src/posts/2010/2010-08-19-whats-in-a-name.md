Someone asked me the other day about the name of my blog, "The Music Plays You".  So, maybe I should explain...

Back when I first started blogging, I knew I'd have to come up with something creative.  Even now, I can't bear to get a domain like "niclake.com" or whatever... it's way too boring.  Right?  Right.  (Even though I'm sure you'd rather just type 11 characters than 30, wouldn't you?)

Back in the day, The Music Plays You was a way for me to express my high school displeasures with the world.  I was in my rebellion stage, the whole "[fight the power](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PaoLy7PHwk)" thing that just about everyone goes through at some point in their lives.  It seemed to me that I had absolutely zero control over my life, and I didn't like it.  I actually remember writing on my old Xanga (lol Xanga... wow, the memories) about all the stupid things I hated about my ex's parents.  I forgot that they stalked her computer profile and knew what she looked at... yeah, that one didn't go over so well.  Haha.

Nowadays, though, there's multiple meanings to it.  Have you ever been to a concert, and realized that for whatever reason, your body just felt like it had to MOVE?  Either a toe tap, or snapping the fingers, or just all-out dancing?  It's uncontrollable, and infectious, and just one of the many great things about music.

Also, as a musician, some of those moments even happen to us.  I never practice a solo, ever.  I'm always sure to nail down some of the lead licks for various songs, but I'm a much bigger fan of improv and variation than I am of routine and repetition.  I have (or at least think I have) a mild case of ADD, so that might be part of it.  I'll be playing, and get to the solo sections, and sometimes won't even have to think.  The music and notes will literally just appear, and I just kinda go with it.

For me, music and emotions go hand in hand.  Certain songs will evoke certain emotions in people.  When I'm in an extreme mood (extremely happy or extremely sad), my playing will be off the charts good.  If it's just a ho-hum kinda day, my playing will just be average.  I find myself focusing on memories quite often when I play, in order to improve my playing on the spot.  As such, I'll get done with a performance and will sometimes be both physically and mentally drained.  It's a weird feeling.

So that's my story... and I'm stickin' to it.  That's why TMPY has slowly evolved from a detailed day-to-day happening in my life into more of a dumping grounds for my philosophical thoughts and feelings.

How about you?  How did you get your various blog titles?
