I've discovered a few things in my 2 days of doing VEDA so far...

1. iMovie is a pain when it comes to doing any sort of audio editing.
2. Adobe Premiere has a massive learning curve, but thankfully I figured out the stuff for what I need.
3. My lisp, while unnoticed by some, is extremely annoying to me.
4. Vlogging is fun.
5. ... but I could easily see how it could be overdone.
6. I grew tired of looking at my blog, so I changed the theme again.  This one should be familiar to a lot of you.

I'll definitely be throwing video blogs in more regularly once VEDA is over and done with, that's for sure.

Anyway, today's topic was favorite drink.  Combine that with tomorrow's topic of hangovers, and I knew the perfect music choice for today's vid.
