I'm just going to throw this out there... days like today, I really, really hate being the good guy.

And before all y'all tell me "oh, well, it's better in the long run" and stuff like that... shut it.  Seriously.

I am probably one of the nicest, friendliest people you will ever meet.  I am tolerant of a wide variety of activities, social statuses, religions, hobbies, vices, and the like.  I like you until you tick me off... then I'll probably still like you afterwards, because that's just how I roll  "Turn the other cheek" and all that jazz.

![](images/machete.jpg)But honestly, I am sick and tired of sticking my neck out on the line for people, and have them take swipes at it with a machete.  Seriously.

I will be more than happy to be your friend.  I will be more than happy to listen to you, talk to you, and be there for you, guy or girl, regardless of age, on whatever subject, whenever you need.  That's just who I am.  But when you screw me over intentionally... when you "play games" with me...  when you go behind my back on something... then my "good guy" attitude ends.  And if you haven't seen my dark side... well, you don't want to.

It's literally taking every once of self control to censor myself and keep myself from cursing through my fingers.  If you want to go re-read the above statement and plug them in where you deem appropriate, be my guest.

If you tell me you have a problem, if you feel like there's something that is worth taking up my time about, then by all means, tell me.  But telling me one story, changing it 3 times, and then giving me a "oh, haha, I was just kidding"... not cool.  Really not cool at all.  Especially if it's about a serious topic that has no reason to be taken lightly.

Seriously... not to be a dick... but the next person that tells me that they are "contemplating suicide" and "needs to talk", and then gives me a "haha I'm just messing with you"... especially on nights where either a) I have things to do or b) I'm doing things with friends... I will seriously punch you in the mouth.  Repeatedly.  I've dealt with that issue on more fronts than you can possibly imagine, and it's not a topic that I take lightly at all.  I don't joke around about that, ever, and you should know that.

Was I doing anything important?  Not tonight.  Was I looking forward to spending some time with my friends?  Absolutely.  Did I ditch them to help you out?  Yep.  Are you telling me that this is all just some fun game you concocted to see how many hoops I would jump through, or how far our friendship would go?  Consider that hoop snapped in half, and that rope stretched to the breaking point.

Oh my goodness, I'm so pissed right now... sorry.  I really needed to vent about this.
