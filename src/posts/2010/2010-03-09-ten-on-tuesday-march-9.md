[![](http://rootsandrings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/rr10tuesday.jpg?w=125&h=125&h=125)](http://rootsandrings.wordpress.com/)**1. Of your current hobbies, which would you choose to spend more time, money, and effort on? Why?** I think guitar takes all 3 of the above categories, although I could really use a nice camera and some lenses.  And why?  Well, I love music, but I really don't put a lot of time or effort towards it, mostly because I live in the dorms and don't want to bother people.  Great excuse, I know.

**2. List the two other hobbies/habitual activies (not chores) besides the one listed above that you regularly do now and didn’t choose in question one.** Let's see... photography was kinda listed. Otherwise, sports, video games, computers, movies, and food are all interests and/or hobbies of mine.

**3. Why are you spending time on the above two hobbies/habitual activies at all if you really wanted to spend your time on the first one you chose?  …or to put it another way, what are these two hobbies/habitual activities fullfilling that the first one doesn’t if you don’t want to put all your effort into the first hobby?** I've asked myself that same question a lot recently. If I took time away from watching movies, playing video games, or whatever else I do in my free time, and put it towards practicing my guitar, I could get to be really, really good. I just... haven't. And I should.

**4. Ready John 3:16 in the bible… In what way does this passage affect you?  What are your feelings towards these words, positively or negatively?** [Here's a link](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=NIV) for those that can't remember it. As for my feelings and reaction? It's a deep relief for me to know this. I'm a Christian, and proud of it. I'm actually planning on writing a post later this week about the subject.

**5. M&M’s: nuts, no nuts, or peanut butter?** Yes please.

**6. Putting away the feeling of pride being a bad thing; what secretly/openly are you proud about yourself?** My musical talents. Actually, it's not a secret. One of my talents will remain a secret, though I will tell you about it if you ask me. I guess I'm glad that I can be there and be a good listener/sound board for people, and help them through whatever it is that they have going on.

**7. Given one room in the house to do with what you want, not changing the actual size of the room and with all the money you would need, what would you do, and be specific?  (this can range from bouncy floor,walls & ceilings; to hard wood floor with wood paneling and purple ceiling with a chair; to nothing)** Well, this would probably be my parent's house, since I'm living in the dorms. I would change their basement. Make it heated, carpeted floors, sound proof, and then put all of my musical equipment down there. There were thoughts about maybe doing this when I was in high school, but they never came to fruition.

**8. What’s the next movie you’re going to see?  Not what you’d LIKE to GO see, but the next movie you realistically are going to watch.** I am going to go see Repo Men. It looks awesome.

**9. Use the keyboard only and make your best smiley/funny/cool face –> like this! 8^)** Being that this isn't a question, I'm giving this a big frowny face... :-(

**10. What makes you cry? What makes you pray? What makes you laugh?** Cry: Pain. No lie, I cried this weekend a little when my back hurt. Pray: The most random things. As will be detailed later, I don't pray much. When I do, it could be about anything and everything. Laugh: Everything. It's a coping mechanism for me. I laugh when I'm hurt, angry, depressed, happy, in love, whatever.
