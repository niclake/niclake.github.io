## Recap of Past Themes

2022 was [The Year of the Garden](/year-of-the-garden/). It was all about prioritizing the habits that would be important to me & my family as we welcomed my daughter into the world. I needed to Harvest the established habits I wanted to maintain, Prune back the habits that were desired but growing out of control, Sowing new habits to have in my life, and Razing the habits that no longer served me.

2023 was [The Year of Sustenance](/year-of-sustenance/). I had essentially copy/pasted the previous theme, feeling a bit *laissez-faire* about the whole ordeal. And wouldn't you know it, ***I got exactly as much out of it as I put in to crafting it for myself*** (which is to say, practically nothing).

2024 was [The Year of Understanding](/year-of-understanding/). I tried to build a couple blocks on top of this, but the core was me trying to analyze and deep dive into not just the *what* or *how* in my life, but the *why*. Am I experiencing road blocks on something over and over again? *Why is that?*

2025 was [The Year of Motion](/year-of-motion/). With a pruned garden, enough to fill my cup, and knowledge about who I was and how I operated, I wanted to keep that momentum going in a positive direction. I had 3 main points of focus:

- Perfection Requires Failure
- Moving Laterally Is Still Motion
- Take the Most Important Step

I don't think it was a successful theme for me. It was a good one; it was the right one; but there still seemed to be a lot of cruft in the way for me to get over.

My whole life, I've been all about completing things. Making cool stuff, beating hard games, reading awesome books, whatever. But for Year of Motion, I was trying to somewhat aimlessly encourage myself to just dive in to stuff and be ok with shit results as I worked towards a goal. But that's hard. And what if I hated the thing I was trying? ***I was feeling obligated to plow through things that didn't serve me, in pursuit of finding enlightenment.***

## Deliberations

A quick (but relevant) aside - in late September, I was playing through **Nine Sols**, an excellent & difficult video game (Metroid-style exploration with Sekiro-like parry-based combat). I loved it. I was enamored. I did everything I needed to do to get the good ending, which made the final boss just a bit harder.

And then I spent a week trying to beat her.

It was brutal. The run back took seconds. I could close my eyes and perfctly do the first phase based on audio cues alone. But phase 2 got much less predictible... and phase 3? Oof. I had no chance. The fights were never more than 2 minutes long, so I'd be right back at it again. And again. And again.

I probably attempted that boss 150 times. Maybe more. I can still hear the rhythm of that fight in my head if I think about it. I wanted so desperately to beat that fight... but also, Silksong had just come out, and I wanted to start playing that...

And then I remembered. Nine Sols has excellent accessibility controls, including allowing players to dial in how much damage they do, as well as how much damage they take. And I remember hearing a podcaster I like talk about his experience with the game, and how he bounced off the final boss hard because of how difficult it became.

So I thought about it. I talked about it. "Is it ok for me to 'give up' and beat the boss? I won't get that cool achievement, but I can see the end of the story and move on!"

(Some of you are reading this going "well duh, of course it's ok". And you're right, it is! But chronic completionists like myself have a REALLY hard time "giving up" on something. So be nice to us, ok?)

I did it. I switched those settings, it took me 30 seconds to win the fight, I saw the ending, it was satisfying, I didn't care that I didn't get meaningless internet points, I uninstalled the game, and I fired up Silksong (yet another excellent & difficult game... I'm sensing a pattern). And I ended up being just fine.

## 2026 - Year of the Reaper

This year, I'm (yet again) building off of & extending my goals from before. Motion is still important, and taking that first step is still the best possible thing for me to do. But my goal is to dabble, to try, to experiment. It's not about the destination, it's about the journey. And sometimes, that road is not one I will want to be on.

My goals this year, as weird as they sound, are as follows:

### Step Into The Experiences

I've had this crochet kit for ages. I want to make it. I want to see what crocheting is like, see if it's something I enjoy doing, but I just have held off on trying for whatever reason.

I'm making a list of 12 (or more) things I want to dabble with this year. Each month, I'll roll a D12, take that experience, and commit to trying it during that month. This is a continuation of Motion from last year.

### Let Joy Grow Naturally

That's right, I'm gonna Marie Kondo the fuck out of my life.

For so long, I've felt the need to fill in the gaps in my schedule with things, hoping to keep myself from being bored or slipping into bad habits. I spent a lot of time in 2022 trying to schedule out and plan all of my free time, hoping to distribute the joy across all of my hobbies, and thus keeping myself well-rounded and enriched.

I think we can all guess how well that worked out.

I'm not going to just say "welp, do whatever". I'm still tracking how much I read, or exercise, or create things, or play games, or watch sports. But I'm doing this tracking on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis, as opposed to an hourly or daily basis. Some months, it's cold as hell outside, there's no baseball on TV, I have a great book or series to read, and I'm going to do nothing but read for the next 60 days and nights. I don't need to shame myself for not playing games, writing, or whatever in that window; I'm happy! Let myself experience this joy!

### Be Ok With Moving On

This is the big one, the core of the year. I MUST be ok with saying "nope, this is not for me" and dropping activities when necessary. Similar to my Year of the Garden, I need to raze things that don't serve me, and prune back other activities that grow out of control.

When a game I want to beat is holding me back from other activities? Move on. When a hobby I'm trying out isn't working? Pack it up, **and don't put it back on the list later**. If a friend is dumping all of their negative emotions on to me every time we talk? Maybe it's time to talk less.

Year of the Reaper is all about becoming unburdened. That burden can be things you're actively holding, but often it can be from the things stuffed deep into your backpack, weighing you down with guilt and memories and "well maybe if I just..." and it must go.

I have nothing pithy with which to end this post. I am ok with moving on. Hopefully, it's for the best.

See you soon.
