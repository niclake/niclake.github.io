Alright, before I begin... trivia question of the night.  Don't cheat and spoil it for yourself.  This decade, there have been 8 teams that have made it to the BCS Championship game (a travesty in and of itself).  Name them.  (Thanks to Shawn for the question... I got 7 of 8.)

![nfl_u_peytonmanning1_576](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/nfl_u_peytonmanning1_576.jpg?w=300 "nfl_u_peytonmanning1_576")Look, we all know the Colts are sick.  7 straight postseason appearances.  Peyton Manning at the helm.  There are obviously a lot of new faces in the Indy camp this year, but the cogs are still meshing and turning just fine for the blue and white.

Look at Peyton's stats tonight... 14/23, 303 yards, 2 TDs (including an 80 yard strike to Dallas Clark on the first play of the game... GO IOWA!!!).  Oh yeah, and he did that while his team had the ball for 14:53.

14:53.

**14:53.**

That's less than a quarter of football.  A record, in fact, for the least amount of time of possession in an NFL win.  I remember doing the Presidential Physical Fitness test back in 5th or 6th grade (I was a very pudgy/unhealthy kid back then) and running jogging walking my mile run in just about that much time.  I don't think my Methodist pastor could parse his sermon down to that length of time if the fate of the world relied on it.  And in that time, Peyton marched his offense up and down the field, getting the 2 passing touchdowns to Clark and Pierre Garcon, handing the ball off to Donald Brown for his 15 yd scamper, and getting Nougetieri Vinatieri in range for 2 field goals.

No wonder he was so sharp... early reports out of Miami is that Manning was caught napping during one of his prolonged breaks on the sidelines.

Probably the more impressive thing about this story is the Indy defense.  Missing Bob Sanders (IOWA!!!), they gave up 107 Pussycat Wildcat rushing yards, and a total of 403 combined yards.  Yet they stiffened when it mattered, forcing 3 long (45, 44, and 45) field goals during key drives to keep the game in hand.  45:07 is an eternity in football, and for this notoriously questionable Colts D to do as well as they did is nothing short of miraculous.

You have to feel a bit for the Dolphins.  They've played 2 solid teams in the Colts and Falcons, performing very well, and coming away with 2 losses.  Their next opponents?  San Diego, Buffalo, the Jets, the Saints, the Jets again, and New England.  Ouch.  The Colts have it slightly easier through week 9, playing against Arizona, Seattle, Tennessee, St. Louis, the 49ers, and Houston (their season gets a little rougher towards the end of the season).

All I have to say is... Ben Watson, you are officially delegated to my fantasy trade block.  Dallas Clark, I'm sorry for ever doubting you.  Accept my humble apology.

Ok, trivia answers.  The easy ones: USC, Texas, Ohio State, Florida, and Oklahoma.  The toughies?  Miami, LSU, and (the one I didn't get) Nebraska.
