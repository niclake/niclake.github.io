![](images/wve-white-flag-260.jpg)I have been back at UNI for exactly 5 weeks now (class for about 4.5), and I am just now waving a temporary white flag.  Last week/weekend was the hellish time for me, yet it just seems to be catching up to me now, a few days later.  Thankfully, my pregnant Info Systems professor has decided to schedule a baby checkup for this afternoon, meaning I'm done at 11am today.  Time to go home, do laundry, and fall asleep on the couch.  Maybe I'll bum a home cooked meal out of it as well. ;-)

Don't get me wrong, I love all the stuff I've got going on right now... these past 5 weeks have absolutely flown by, and that was before I found all these things to do.

- 2 lectures per day (10 and 1 MWF, or 9:30 and 2 T/Th) for 4 classes
- 1 online lecture to stay up to date on for Personal Wellness
- Random group meetings for Humanities
- Work MWF mornings, and Sun/Mon evenings (plus random shifts I acquire)
- Church at least one night a week, plus Sunday mornings
- Football Saturdays (usually meaning I'm at the UNI football game) and Sundays
- Various online quizzes throughout the weeks
- Maintaining a fairly regular stream of articles for both [my sports blog](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com), as well as for the [Most Valuable Network](http://www.mvn.com)
- Various bike rides, tennis... we'll call them "practices", rounds of golf, disc golf, working out, swimming, and basketball excursions.
- Homework, obviously
- Playing guitar (about an hour+ every day now)
- Figuring out new and creative ways of removing pungent odors from a tiny dorm room (harder than you think)

And even with all that, I still feel like I have quite a bit of free time in which to nap, play video games with friends, or other things.

Side note: Weird moment of the day yesterday... talking to my dad on the phone (who I know reads this... hopefully he gets a chuckle out of this as well), he reminded me to "keep free time in my schedule ... for the ladies".  For reference, Dad, to properly embarrass your children, you have to say things like that in the presence of their peers... over the phone doesn't work out quite as well. ;-)

One of the pluses to all the "busy stuff" that I've got going on is that quite a bit of it is conducive to me listening to my iPod and all the new music I've put on it recently... I've definitely found some good artists lately that you should check out...

- The Album Leaf (Ambient Post-Rock)
- Alexisonfire (Post-Hardcore)
- Bloc Party (Indie Electro Rock)
- The Bravery (Alternative Rock)
- Cage9 (Alternative Rock)
- Deas Vail (Piano Rock)
- Emanuel (Post-Hardcore)
- Emarosa (Post-Hardcore)
- The Glorious Unseen (Christian Rock)
- He Is Legend (Post-Hardcore)
- Ivoryline (Alternative/Christian Rock)
- Manchester Orchestra (Indie Rock)
- MuteMath (Alternative Rock)
- Phoenix (Alternative Rock)
- Thrice (Post-Rock)
- Thriving Ivory (Indie Rock)

That's just naming a handful of the groups that I'm jonesing on at this point in time.

Have you ever noticed how most Americans, while claiming to have all sorts of friends and be "so well off", are a very odd combination of cattle and antisocial misfits?  Take these examples:

- In high school (actually anywhere, but high school was a great example), my friends and I actually got it to where people were walking down the left (wrong) side of the hall, by just getting a cluster of us and doing it.  We got strange looks for the better part of first and second period breaks, but by the time lunch was over, you could find just as many people walking on the left side of the hall as you did the right.  People will fall into line, as most don't like being leaders, but rather are just content with following the examples set by others.
- Right now, in my computer lab, we have 39 computer arranged in rows of 6-7.  There are 8 people in here right now... 2 are working on a group project, 2 are in the same row but spread out as far away from each other as possible, and everyone else has taken their own row by themselves.  Why are people so afraid of social contact?  I honestly don't get it.

I'll admit, I'm not necessarily the most outwardly social human on the planet... especially if she's cute and female.  I'm just fascinated by the actions that we subconsciously make sometimes  It'd be kinda interesting to study that sometime, see if you can place a finger on why things are like this.

Enough rambling... time for a short nap (yes, here at work) before my one class of the day.
