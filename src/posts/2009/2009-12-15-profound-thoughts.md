> "It doesn't matter if the glass is half empty or half full, it's who is pouring the water that matters."

It's with that profound statement of the evening that I have decided on what my New Year's resolution is going to be.

![](images/pouring-water.jpg)I need to preface this a little... I've never really done a NYR before.  I've tried.  But nothing's come out of them.  They were dumb ones too.  "Lose weight." "Exercise more."  How many of those do you think ever worked for people?  (Along these same lines, I've never done Lent either.  I'm a bad person.)

Anyway, my goal right now \*is\* to exercise more and lose weight.  When I got into college, I weighed 170.  After the first semester (which was chock full of caring a snare drum around during marching band), I was down to 155.  I was happy, energetic, and for the next... oh, almost year and a half, I pretty much kept around 160.  Then, after the breakup with my ex (which pretty much devastated me emotionally), I got lazy, lethargic, un-motivated, and (in turn) fatter.  After spending time working for Deere/Hy-Vee (and not having my work pants fit... damn, that was annoying) and returning to school, I checked my weight again.  190.

Ouch.

Right now, I'm down to 180.  Better, but not great.  I have a nasty habit of eating/drinking random junk food because I get bored.  Sounds stupid, but it's true.  Watching sports?  Chips and salsa.  Movie time?  Grab a pop.  Gotta study?  Chocolate!

So... I have determined that I'm done with this.  Pre-New Year's, I'm cutting out the purchasing of chips.  (I could use some good snack recommendations though... I have these Nature Valley granola bars, but variety is the spice of life.)  It'll be pretty easy to avoid those over the holiday break, I think.  My actual NYR is \*drumroll...\*

_...to cut out all purchases of pop.  And in turn, drink more water._

I figure this is a pretty easy goal to accomplish.  It's kinda expensive anyway, so that's a motivator right there.  (I know, $1.25, whoopee... but really...)  Lots of calories and sugar.  I love the stuff, but if I keep it out of my fridge, that will stop 95% of my motivation right there.

I'm sure I'll have a pop every now and again.  Going over to a friend's house, I may have one.  2 of my "standard" drinks are rum-and-Coke and Mt.Dew/vodkas... not that I drink frequently... and so technically, it's an alcoholic beverage purchase.  I may snag a glass of it from the dining center on occasion, though I routinely drink about 24oz of water every meal... even still, that wouldn't be a purchase.  The real kicker is going to be when I'm getting Café on the Way (our "to-go" dining service).  My only options there are hot chocolate, coffee, pop/other sugary beverages, or 2% milk (I hate skim/chocolate milk).  I guess I could just skip the drinks, but that seems like a waste of money/meals in my opinion... I'll need to think that one through.

But... this is my request to you, ladies and gentlemen.  Most of you who read this know me personally.  Some of you hang around me frequently.  I implore you... help me on this.  I left myself wiggle room on my NYR on purpose, because I know that completely cutting out my primary source of caffeine is going to be tricky.  However, I still hope that people call me out on it.  If you see me drinking one, tell me to knock it off.  Dump it on my head.

Ok, don't really dump it on my head.  That would be mean.

But yes... help me not drink pop.  Also, suggest healthy snacks.  I like snacks.
