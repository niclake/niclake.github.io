Look around you.  Look at everything that we as Americans, as human beings, have at our disposal on a day-to-day basis.  It's kinda shocking.

Now think back 5, 10, 15 years.  Think of the things that didn't exist then, and how much we rely on them today, and how fast we've gotten to where we are now.

Every time I go home, I'm reminded of technology changing the way things are done, even on a small scale.  Back in the day, records were \*the\* source for music.  My dad has an entire bookshelf (I guess you can't really call it a bookshelf, but whatever) chock full of records... hundreds, maybe a few thousand of them.  Plus, he (used to, at least) has boxes and boxes of albums in his basement, just sitting there.  I remember he'd put on some random album when I was younger as he did chores around the house.

I also remember when I got my first tape player.  I actually have a pair of small tape shelving things in my bedroom, full of everything from Michael Jackson to some random mix tapes that my dad made for me when I was in grade school.  I should get one of those MJ tapes and play it in my car, just for kicks...

Then CDs.  Can you remember the first CD you ever purchased/owned?  I can... the Mortal Kombat Annihilation soundtrack (embarrassing... but I still have it to this day).

And now, the technology is... well, nothing.  Computer files.  Nothing hard and tangible, just small media files to load onto your iPods and Zunes and whatnot.  My dad got a new record player a few months back that will convert all his records to mp3s.  Instead of a stereo, he just pipes iTunes through the stereo system.

 

Or think about phones.  When I was a kid, a cell phone didn't exist for average families.  I remember my percussion instructor had a pretty ghetto bag phone in... one of the vans he drove, either his personal van or the school van.  You watch movies every once in a while where the cell phone looks like an unopened box of Klenexx.  Then we had the big, bulky block phones (bigger than today's Blackberries) that only made calls.  Then the flip phones.  Then texting came into the mix, so we got "smart phones" and phones with keyboards.  Sliders.  Music phones.  And now we have things like the iPhone, which is basically a PC in your pocket that just so happens to make phone calls as well.

 

As not-funny as it might be... could you imagine what would happen to society if something a la Live Free, Die Hard actually happened?  All internet/communications going down all of a sudden?  People wouldn't know what to do with themselves.  Perez Hilton might die if he couldn't keep track of the "hot celebrity" of the day.

I don't know what really prompted me writing this... probably a lot of things.  I'm sitting here, watching ESPN, talking to various people on AIM and Facebook Chat, texting others, while listening to some Zeppelin on my computer.

Ah, technology...
