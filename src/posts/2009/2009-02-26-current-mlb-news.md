I'm sitting here watching some college basketball (UConn and Marquette was an excellent game, Maryland and Duke is shaping up to be as well), and I saw 2 stories go by on the MLB ticker that made me wonder what's wrong with the sports world.

- Dodgers Improve Offer to Manny - The Dodgers have offered Manny Ramierez a $25m contract for 1 year, with a \*player-only\* $20m for a second year.
- A-Rod Exits with Sucart After Game - Sources saw Alex Rodriguez exit the stadium with cousin Yuri Sucart, who is allegedly A-Rod's former source for steroids back in 2001-2003.

First off... enough A-Rod.  Even as a Red Sox fan, I'm disgusted, both with how the media keeps digging into everything he does, as well as the fact that all we're hearing about is him.  Give it up already.

Regarding Manny... the Dodgers have just signed their own death warrant.  Giving Manny the 1 year contract is going to make him disgruntled as it is (though maybe he's realized there's not much of a market for him anymore), and then on top of that, you're giving not the team, not the manager, but Manny himself to determine if he wants to gouge you for another $20m the next season.  What?  Manny got kneecapped in the '09 offseason?  Too bad.  What?  Manny can't hit anymore, still doesn't run, and his hair is so long it rips the catcher's mask off with every swing?  Too bad.

You know what I hear out of Red Sox camp this year?

Nothing.

It's wonderful.  It's the greatest thing ever.  Let the guys be normal, let them enjoy their training in peace without the extra drama.  (Ok, I guess Papi stating his stance on the steroid issue is something, but that's a stance I agree with.)

I need to check the calendar... I kinda hope the Red Sox and Dodgers play interleague this year.
