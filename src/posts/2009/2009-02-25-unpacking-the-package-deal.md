As I was out celebrating a friend's 21st birthday last night, I got to thinking... what's the deal with these package deals I keep hearing about in NCAA basketball?

I think strange things when I drink.

Anyway... In terms of sports, "package deals" are referring to schools hiring coaches, assistant directors of \_\_\_\_\_, or anything of the sort in order to acquire a player.  The coach/assistant could be a parent, a former coach, a friend, or something similar.

This practice is strictly forbidden, and is considering a recruiting violation.  It's really tough to prove something like this, however.  Many schools have employeed former coaches or parents of their star players, but it's very easy to just say "well, we met this guy during the recruitment process, and we just felt that he would make a great addition to our coaching staff.... totally not related to why we signed (insert athlete here)..." and suddenly they have a "bubble-wrapped" alibi.

Examples? Ok. ([Thank you, About.com](http://collegebasketball.about.com/od/recruiting/a/ncaa-package.htm))

- 2008 Final Four hero [Mario Chalmers](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com/od/ncaatournament/tp/greatestplays.htm) arrived at KU with his dad, Ronnie. The elder Chalmers -- a respected coach at the high school level -- served as director of basketball operations for Bill Self. As often seems to be the case in these situations, Ronnie Chalmers [left KU shortly after his son](http://community.foxsports.com/blogs/goodmanonfox/2008/08/12/PACKAGE_ALL_WRAPPED_UP).
- John Calipari's first big-time recruit at Memphis was Dajuan Wagner, a high-scoring guard from Camden, New Jersey. In order to get his name on a letter of intent, Wagner's father Milt was given a job on Calipari's staff -- despite the fact that the [senior Wagner didn't have a college degree](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6DD113BF936A15752C1A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1). Arthur Barclay -- Wagner's best friend -- also received a scholarship.
- Not to pick on the Jayhawks, but Chalmers wasn't the first high-profile recruit to arrive in Lawrence with an entourage. Larry Brown famously gave his ex-ABA teammate Ed Manning an assistant position as a means of recruiting Manning's son Danny -- who, like Chalmers, went on to lead the Jayhawks to a national title. The elder Manning was driving a truck for a living before landing the assistant's job.

(By the way... this practice also occurs in NCAA Football \[and probably other sports\] as well.  I'm just covering the basketball aspect here.)

The NCAA actually created a 3-member committee this spring to monitor this specific infraction.  It's unclear to me who they're looking at, or what their findings are;  however, in an interview on ESPN last night, the head of the committee mentioned that there are numerous instances that they are looking into, as well as to the official definition of the rule and how it might be better worded/enforced in the future.

This violation has been "unboxed" recently due to the actions that have been taken by the Baylor basketball program.  Here's a [quote from Seth Davis](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/seth_davis/08/26/hoop.thoughts/index.html?eref=T1), a writer for SportsIllustrated.com, on the subject:

> Baylor coach **Scott Drew** caused a few ripples last month when he hired a man named **Dwon Clifton** to be his director of player development (whatever that is). The reason this hire was noteworthy is that Clifton had been coaching a summer team called D-One that features **John Wall**, a 6-foot-4 point guard from Raleigh, N.C., whom many people (including myself) consider to be the best high school senior in America.
> 
> No doubt Drew can credibly claim Clifton is qualified for the job. He played at Clemson and UNC-Greensboro before competing professionally for one season in Portugal. Drew can also credibly claim he didn't get an explicit guarantee from Clifton that Wall will sign with Baylor.
> 
> Yet, I can also credibly claim two things: First, Clifton would not have been hired had he not had been Wall's summer coach. And second, as surely as the sun will rise in the east tomorrow morning, John Wall will be a Baylor Bear.

Now, from what I understand, Mr. Davis is considered by many bloggers and writers across America to be "scum", on par with Andy Katz as "tabloid writers" who stir up trouble just to meet their weekly quota of stories.  However, this is one of those things that we really need to buckle down on, regardless of who's writing about it or what teams they're mentioning in their articles.

My question is... say this comes to fruition and the NCAA does find teams in violation.  What happens then?  Would KU lose their national championships from having Chalmers and Manning on their team?  Would current players/employees involved in these deals be "shipped out"?  The NCAA needs to start thinking about this now... if they have put a committee together to research the issue, my guess is that they're planning on finding some offenders.  The sooner that they can cut down on these offenses, the better it will be for the sport.

For now, though, I'm going to mark this story as "return to sender", and enjoy some postseason college basketball.
