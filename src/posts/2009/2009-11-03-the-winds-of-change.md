I've noticed that people nowadays really look at change in a very narrow way.  Not saying that this is a bad thing at all, but it's an observation.

I had lunch with Q today, and he brought up some very good points about a few things.  We were talking about my desire in the future to get an internship in another city, or move somewhere after I graduate, or even just looking for additional opportunities for me to play guitar at/get involved with other churches.  Not really looking to change what I'm doing (a more vertical change), but rather just changing location while keeping my general activities constant.  When you think about it, a lot of people are doing that right now.  I have a couple friends that either have moved or are planning on moving, not necessarily because of a job or life or anything, but just because they feel like they need a change of scenery or want to leave Cedar Falls or the like.

Instead, Q brought up a great point.  Maybe instead of changing locations, why don't I just change what I'm doing?  Get myself more involved in activities and organizations that I'm already a part of.  Maybe instead of just playing guitar on Sundays, I should help out on the planning and practices.  Instead of complaining that "Cedar Falls is boring", maybe I should be looking for new activities to partake in, or find ways to improve existing things that I'm not necessarily happy with.

And this is true for all aspects of life.  Why make lateral changes with anything, trying to skate around the issue at hand, when we as a society are so smart and so diverse in our knowledge and interests that we can make those vertical changes?

Side note: These peanuts are delicious, but would be much better if they were honey roasted instead of just dry roasted.
