Remember when Ortiz and Manny used to do this all the time after a hit?

In the top of the 8th, Ortiz put a shot into right center and ended off on 2nd.  While I'm sure he was obviously excited to finally get a hit and get out of his slump, he had absolutely no emotion about it.  Granted, his hit made the game 7--0, but still... show some life, Papi.

Could you imagine Youk coming to the top step and giving Ortiz "the point"?  Just to lighten him up a little.
