So, as I sit here doing nothing on New Year's Eve, I've decided that I'm going to start using my blog more.  I don't know what I'm going to put on it... thoughts of the day, rants, new music I like, and stuff like that.

  

First thought of the new year?  Heartburn sucks.

  

I'm looking forward to the new year.  In all honesty, last year sucked pretty bad... between bad grades at school, financial aid screwing me over, bad medical stuff, crappy relationships, and officially having to join the working world, it just wasn't a very good time.  I've determined that I really miss school... both the structures and freedoms that it offers students is a great thing.  I'm hoping to go back here in August and get my business degree.  After being on the low end of the totem pole for a year now, I realize how important having a degree really is, so hopefully UNI and I can reconcile our financial differences in time for the upcoming school year.

  

What about 2009?  I don't really know yet... my resolution is to become healthy again.  I figure that's not only easy, but all-encompassing, so I figure I'm good there.  Try and eat healthy, exercise, and all that good stuff.  My biggest pet peeve is that I didn't have music to listen to while I was working out, but now I have an iPod (thanks, Grandma), so I have no excuse.

  

364 days, 23 hours, and 18 minutes left of this year.  I'm gonna make the most of it.
