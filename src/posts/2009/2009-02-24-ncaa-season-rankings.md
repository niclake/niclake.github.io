Every season for college sports, one of the big topics is always who's the current #1 for a given week, who busted into the rankings, who fell out, and so on. Obviously, this is a great treat not only for the teams to strive for, but for the fans to follow and boast about.

But does it have an impact on the games themselves?

During the regular season this past season, #2 Penn State went in to Kinnick Stadium to play the Iowa Hawkeyes in a Big Ten football matchup.  The general populace predicted a massive drubbing from Joe Paterno's Nitney Lions.  Any dummy could've guess that a #2 ranked team would've pounded a non-ranked opponent.  Right?

Wrong.

The Hawkeyes pulled off one of the greatest upsets of the season, beating Penn State on a last-second field goal, and thus ending Penn State's chances of a perfect season and a national championship shot.  I, for one, was absolutely stunned, but also ecstatic at the same time, and I definitely didn't have a voice the next few days.

My question is this... How much of Iowa's great play stemmed from good coaching, a good game plan, or good execution that day?  Would that have put up such a great fight against just any opponent?  Or most of all... did that #2 appended to the front of the Lion's team have any bearing on their performance whatsoever?

We always talk about the big upsets in football, basketball, or any other college sport, and most of those upsets have to do with "ranked vs. unranked" teams playing each other.  But is this necessary?  Honestly, I feel that the rankings during the actual season are for only one purpose, and that's to keep the general public informed on where their favorite team might stand, or to use as hype material when two top ranked teams compete against each other.  But what we have to remember is that players are fans too.  Believe it or not, they pay attention to what the media has to say about their team.

When PSU drove into Iowa, the Hawkeyes did not look at this as "ok, we're playing a good team at home, let's go out there and give it our best shot".  Instead, the mentality was more "#2 team, in our house.  They're not walking out with it".  I honestly think the ranking hurt the Lions.  Teams don't need any more fuel to add to the fire when they play one another, and they honestly could've just gone ahead and painted a bulls-eye on their white helmets... it would've had the same effect.

So what do I propose?  ..... Absolutely nothing.  There's nothing that's going to happen.  These rankings aren't going to go away.  #15 Kansas played #3 Oklahoma in college basketball and beat them by 9 this evening in an absolutely stellar game.  Obviously it was hyped up by sporting networks.  Obviously the coaches, players, and fans all knew that while this game didn't have much bearing on postseason play (they'll both get into the NCAA tournament), stepping up and beating a highly-ranked opponent would "prove" to everyone how good of a team they were, which would impress the selection committee, which allows them to get a good seed in the tournament.

All these little things, added on top of one another, over and over and over again... it's hard to pinpoint one particular thing that changes the outcome of a game.  I, for one, believe that rankings just make people gun for you even harder, and definitely have an outcome on how teams prepare and play on a specific day.
