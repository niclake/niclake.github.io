I need to take a moment and comment about the recent state of affairs in the world of baseball.  The league and all of its fans have lost 3 members in a week, with the passing of Nick Adenhart (22), Harry Kalas (73), and Mark Fidrych (54).

![](images/large_nick-adenhart409.jpg)Adenhart, of the Angels organization, was a rising star in the majors.  6 innings of 7-hit ball, with 3 walks and 5 strikeouts.  How's that for your first start of a season, from a young guy (I say young with a grain of salt... the guy was less than a half a year older than me) looking to make his final push into a Major League rotation.  I caught a few glimpses of the game throughout the night... his stuff was fantastic.  He had the poise of a veteran, working himself out of trouble situations with ease and confidence.  That night, he and his passengers get hit by a car that ran a red light.  The driver's BAC was over three times the legal limit.

If it comes to light that said gentleman was out celebrating an Angels victory... well, there will be hell to pay.

You know what one of the worst feelings in the world is?  You watch a person pitch.  You critique their stuff.  You do some research.  You jot a note down to yourself to watch the kid play another game, check his stats, and if he shows that he's not just a fluke, to add him to your fantasy team.  You wake up the next morning to find the guy dead, and one of your first thoughts is "well, I'm glad I didn't drop anyone off my team last night".  It's funny how much of a reality check moments like that can be.

![](images/kalas.jpg)Harry Kalas, on the other hand, was a long-time broadcaster for the Philadelphia Phillies.  I don't know much about the man, but I do appreciate his craft.  Anyone that can make a career of sports radio broadcasting is a friend of mine.

You see, there's just something magical about sports commentators.  You almost develop a bond with these people, and they become your friends.  Every Saturday, if an Iowa Hawkeyes football game wasn't on TV or I was out on the road, I remembered tuning in to Gary Dolphin to listen to the game.  Now, I listen to the Northern Iowa basketball and football broadcasts (and for the life of me, can't think of our broadcaster's names... I feel terrible), and every week I'm rewarded with their trademark "KABOOM!" and "Oh baby, I love this team!".  I wish I could afford MLBTV, but I also wish I could just get various MLB team's radio broadcasts piped to my computer.  If you've never listened to a sporting event on the radio before, take some time out of your spring/summer/fall and do so.  Today's culture is too dependent on immediate gratification, and can't take the time to let a broadcaster take their mind on an adventure as they describe the game.

Kalas made his home in the city where any sports figure was a fair target.  Hell, even Santa Claus was a fair target.  Kalas, however, was a gem in that town, and passed on in the booth a few hours before a game, preparing to do what he loved.

![](images/184e4480.jpg)Finally, we come to Mark Fidrych.  Another member of baseball that is completely out of my era, but completely fascinating nonetheless, Fidrych was known as "The Bird" around Detroit, with strange behaviors and antics making him an instant star for the Tigers.  While only pitching (if my memory serves me correctly) 60 games during his career, none were more memorable than those he threw during his 1976 season.  Check out these stats:

AL Rookie of the Year.  MLB ERA leader (2.34).  AL leader in complete games (24).  #3 in AL for WHIP (1.079).  #4 in wins (19).  #4 in AL in win percentage (.679).  #5 in AL in shutouts (4).

All that, and he finished 2nd in the Cy Young voting to Jim Palmer, who won back to back awards in '75 and '76.

Fidrych was known for manicuring the mound to his liking, talking to the baseball, his enthusiasm for infielders who made an out for him, his fast pitching pace (many games he pitched in were completed in less than 2 hours), and his distaste for "balls with hits in them".  When asked about why he'd ask the umpires for new balls after a hit, he responded: "That ball has a hit in it, so I want it to get back in the ball bag and goof around with the other balls in there. Maybe it'll learn some sense and come out as a pop-up next time."  Sadly, Fidrych's career was cut woefully short due to an undiagnosed torn rotator cuff suffered in '77.

Nowadays, the only characters we talk about in sports are the ones with inflated egos, inflated biceps, or inflated contracts.  Learning about Fidrych over the last few days makes me miss the days when sports were more pure.  Sadly, I don't think I'll ever see that again in my lifetime, but it's fun to learn about the history of a sport that love so dearly.

Baseball has had too much practice with stress and grief over these past few months, and these deaths have shaken the league even more.  3 men.  3 generations.  All of them, losses that stab the baseball community to the core.  A young prospect with loads of potential.  An elderly man with a voice that tamed Philadelphia.  A comedian on the mound, whos antics charmed a nation and whos pitches baffled opposing hitters.

Rest in peace, gents.  You will all be missed.
