So, as I've stated before, I moonlight over at the [Most Valuable Network](http://www.mvn.com) as a writer for their [Football Wire](http://www.mvn.com/thefootballwire) blog.  I've pulled some strings, and gotten permission to post my articles both there and here on this blog, and so from now on, you will get brief little notices here when a new post goes up.

If you're interested in some Fantasy Football writings, I've got 2 up thus far...

- [Fantasy 101: Early Season Dos and Don'ts](http://mvn.com/thefootballwire/2009/09/fantasy-101-early-season-dos-and-donts.html) - Some brief discussion on the things that you should really focus on, both before/during your draft and in the early moments of the season.
- [Fantasy 101: The Art of Crying](http://mvn.com/thefootballwire/2009/09/fantasy-101-the-art-of-crying.html) - Any dedicated football fan will have a rough time playing Fantasy Football, either from the general frustration or from the annoyance of having to root for your most dreaded enemies so you can win your weekly matchup.  This is telling you that you're not alone, and ways to cope with these struggles.

Man, it feels good to be back in the swing of things...
