It's slightly frustrating living in a college town. I'm used to the bustle and congestion of having ... how many students does UNI have? 12,000? Anyway, I just drove back from Waterloo (congrats on graduating from nursing school, Ashlinn), on a Friday night... and there's absolutely nobody around.

You'd think that I'd be used to this by now... but I'm not.

All registered for summer and fall classes, and I've got the financial aid in waaaay early... so hopefully I don't have to deal with that bunk all over again.  Principals of Marketing in June, Humanities 3 in July, and then a full load in the fall (Macro Economics, Personal Wellness, Intro to Information Systems, Humanities 1, and Physics).  Got a job working in the Business computer lab this coming school year as well, so that's taken care of.

\*cracks fingers\* It's time to figure out my summer, I think.  Things to do...

1) Get in shape.  Again.  My goal is \*at least\* losing 10 lbs.  I'd prefer to drop 20, but I'll take what I can get at this point.  To get myself to a BMI that's not considered "overweight" would require me to practically starve myself... so I'm not going there. 2) Learn Java.  Something else to add to a résumé. 3) Relearn C, pretend to relearn C++, and start learning Objective-C/Cocoa.

(for those that don't know, 2 and 3 are related to computer programming languages... Java is my current project, while Objective-C and Cocoa are the primary languages for developing new programs for Macs and the iPhone/iPod Touch)

 4) Work.  Somewhere.  I don't care at this point.  I'm waiting to hear back from about 10 jobs, all of which I've called back, some numerous times.  I'm looking for new jobs every day, but my luck streak in terms of working seems to have run out.  Rawr (means I'm Angry in Dinosaur). 5) Guitar, guitar, guitar.  I'll have the apartment all to myself, practically no neighbors, and at least a month with nothing to do but (hopefully) work.  I haven't really had a chance to sit down with an electric guitar/amp/effects in a long long time, so I can't even explain how excited I am about this. 6) B+'s or better in my summer classes.  Obviously, I want straight A's.  They'd fix my GPA even faster, and I'd feel awesome... and I think for Humanities, I'm shooting for a minimum of an A-.  However, Principles of Accounting is a 100-level business college course... and rumor has it that the teacher gives rough tests.  I have a hard enough time with tests as it is... so we shall see how it goes.  7) Write.  I miss it.  Stories, novels, lyrics... whatever.  I've had thoughts for about 3 or 4 stories/novels for a couple of years now... it's time I actually do something about those.  I also need to keep up [with my other blog](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com) as well... I keep getting tons of e-mails from people wondering where the posts are.

All of those but 5 are going to transition over into the fall as well, which I have no problem with.

The only thing I'm not looking forward to?  More than likely I'm going to have a roommate when I go back, since I'm living in the dorms.  I've gone through enough roommate drama... so either a) I hope that I somehow \*don't\* have one, or b) this one is super cool and we get along great.

More later.
