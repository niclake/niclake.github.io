Lately, I've been looking around at various people's computer work environments, getting different ideas for how to customize mine.  Anyone who's been around me and my computers for more than a few minutes knows the degree of customization that I utilize on my machines.  Most of it is based upon the personal desire to retain as much information at a brief glance as possible.  I figured I would share a few of these shots with you.

Lately, I've become slightly enamored with the blog [Minimal Mac](http://www.minimalmac.com), and taken after a couple of their tips that they have in order to clear my screen of the useless clutter.

First, you'll notice that I have no hard drives on my desktop, nor any other files.  I try to keep all of my data relatively organized, keeping the desktop clear for more important, immediate things... most of which immediately get filed themselves.  To launch any document, folder, or application, I usually utilize [Quicksilver](http://www.blacktree.com/), which is quite possibly one of the greatest and most powerful programs to ever grace a computer.

I do keep my frequently-used applications in my Dock (though the dock is routinely hidden).  They are:

- Finder
- [Adium](http://adium.im/) (a AIM/MSN/lots more chat client)
- Mail
- Safari (sue me... Firefox takes about 20-30 seconds to launch on this machine.  I'm not a hater.)
- [Tweetie](http://www.tweetie.com/)
- [](http://www.tweetie.com/)[NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/) (to manage/read all my RSS feeds, as well as keep Google Reader in sync with what I do)
- [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) (an IRC chat client, used to communicate with CedarLUG members)
- [PandoraBoy](http://code.google.com/p/pandoraboy/) (a desktop Pandora client)
- iCal
- [HandBrake](http://handbrake.fr/) (used for ripping DVDs)
- [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) (a BitTorrent client)
- System Preferences.

I also have my 2 external hard drives and my Downloads folder in my dock.  [Bowtie](http://bowtieapp.com/) is also camped out there to the left.  I've been using Y[ou Control Tunes](http://www.yousoftware.com/tunes/) for the longest time, but I figured that I would give this program a shot, see if I could keep my 1.5gHz processor from being sucked dry every time a song changes.

I've also made some modifications and additions to my menu bar.  From right to left:

- [iStat Menus](http://www.islayer.com/apps/istatmenus/) - Date and Time, Drives, CPU, and Network features enabled.  I use the clock as a replacement since it is less cumbersome, and also includes a drop-down calendar.  The others, I found, are just more aesthetically pleasing than [MenuMeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/), which I used previously.
- Time Machine - just so I can know when it's updating... if it's anything other than a scan, it likes to suck up my processor.
- [Meteorologist](http://meteorologist.en.softonic.com/mac) - I like to keep track of the weather, and this has been by far the best tracker for that.
- [Mail Unread Menu](http://www.loganrockmore.com/MailUnreadMenu/) - shows me how many unread messages I have across all my e-mail accounts.
- [Dropbox](http://www.getdropbox.com/) - 2 GB of free space to share files from computer to computer?  Yes please.
- Adium and Tweetie also have little buttons up at the top, when the programs are open.

Sort of complex, but like I said, it puts all the information I desire directly at my fingertips.

And now, for my Ubuntu machine.

\[caption id="attachment\_242" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Ubuntu 9.04, running on a 17" HP machine."\][![Screenshot](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/screenshot.png?w=300 "Screenshot")](http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/1700/screenshotmg.png)\[/caption\]

Same sort of deal with this machine.  The simpler, the better.  You can see all the programs that I use listed along the top bar there.  Firefox, Pidgin (chat client), Twhirl (for Twitter), Thunderbird (mail and calendar), XChat (IRC), the OpenOffice Word replacement, Terminal, System Status, and Stickies.  To the right, you have the processor, various system processes (like network, RAM usage, and so on), the weather (which apparently hadn't updated when I took the screenshot), my battery, the Dropbox interface, wireless, volume, date and time, and user switcher.

Really, I only use this machine when I'm not in my room.  I use this to do homework, take notes (if teachers allow it), and for generic web browsing and other usage.  Shawn got me into using Ubuntu about 9 months back, and I'd never use Windows again if I could get away with it.

So there you have it.  My machines.  If you've got any questions, comments, or recommendations, feel free to let me know.
