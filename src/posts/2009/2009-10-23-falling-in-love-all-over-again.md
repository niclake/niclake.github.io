I love sports.

There's really no question about it.  Sports rock.  Drama, passion, excitement.  The thrills and joy when your team wins.  The sadness and heartbreak when they don't.  I'm sitting here right now rooting my heart out for the Angels, just because I hate the Yankees that much.  (Is that like hoping that an ex acquires an STD from a Peruvian transvestite?  Meh... I digress...)

But out of everything, football has to be my favorite sport.  The physicality, the aggression, and the size matched up with the guts, intelligence, and speed.  Brief spurts of action followed by a moment to catch your breath.  More "ooo" and "aaah" moments than Christmas morning.  College or professional, there's something there for everyone.

Last year, football and I had a little bit of a falling out.  I had other things (work and World of Warcraft... \*shudder\*) occupying my time, and I just didn't follow football like I used to.  It was really unfortunate.  The only game that I have any sort of recollection over is the Iowa upset over then-#3 Penn State.  I vowed pretty much from that time forward that I would not let football (nor any other sport) escape me again.

"Ah, but how can you do that?  If you're busy, or you have other things you want to do, what's going to get you to pay attention any more than you did last year?"  That's the simple question... I'll tell you how, in 3 easy steps.

**1) Do a Pick'em with friends/online.** To get immersed in a sport, there is no better option than this.  I'm serious.  Every week, me and 7 of my friends pick winners for a handful of NCAA football games, and 6 of them join me in picking all the NFL games every week.  You have to study the teams, know who's good at what, and (of course) get a little lucky.  Originally I thought it would be something that I'd have to work really hard at getting people to participate, but I usually have their picks back to me by Wednesday at the latest.  It's simple, it's easy, it's fun, and if you have enough people, it can turn into a nice little competition.

**2) Participate in fantasy sports.** The only way to really get more immersed than just doing pick'ems is to do fantasy sports.  Pick'ems is all about following a team, but you have to follow the players themselves in fantasy.  How is this running back going to fare against this defense?  Is this guy going to have a better day than this one?  Still a lot of luck involved, but also a lot of common sense.  (Side note: any time I see a stat line for a player now, I instantly convert those stats into their fantasy points in my league.  Kinda pathetic, but also extremely humorous.)  If you think you like a sport, and think you know a thing or two about the players, this will be a great thing for you.

**3) Watch teams you don't normally follow.** To best describe this, I need to transition to a different sport.  In college basketball, I follow a couple different leagues... Big 10, Big 12, ACC, and the Missouri Valley.  Never have been a Big East guy until last year (go see [my very very early post](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com/2009/02/15/the-big-men-the-new-face-of-college-basketball/) for talks about the big men in that league last year).  One night in early/mid March, I didn't have much to do, and decided to turn on ESPN to their basketball game.  Syracuse/UConn.  For those that don't remember... this was the Big East tournament game that ended off Syracuse 127, UConn 117 in 6 overtimes.  6.  Seriously, that was the best singular sporting event that I've ever seen (beating out any of the Yankees/Red Sox 2004 ALCS games, hands down).  I knew a handful of names, I knew the team's reputations, and that's about it.  Now?  I'm not going to miss a Big East game if I can avoid it this upcoming season.  You truly never know when you're going to see an epic game, and you always have to keep your eyes open (or get a nice TV with Picture in Picture).

I guess you could even compare the Packers/Vikings game we already had this season to this.  The highest rated cable television show ever, most of them watching just because it's Favre playing against his former team.  I'm extremely curious how many of those people were just casual fans, tuning in because of the "magnitude of the game", and how many of those people have continued to follow either of those teams (or the NFL in general) ever since.

I really can't wait.  Each week, I'm looking forward to every game, every score, every run and pass, every sack.  I'm already looking forward to college basketball, (some) NBA, more hockey, the Olympics, the World Cup, the start of the next baseball season... I love it.

Maybe this is why I don't have a girlfriend...
