[_Yankees_](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/clubhouse?team=nyy) _third baseman_ [_Alex Rodriguez_](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3115) _will have surgery to remove a cyst from his right hip and will be out 10 weeks, Rodriguez's brother told ESPNdeportes.com on Thursday._

_Joe Rodriguez, Alex Rodriguez's older brother, told Enrique Rojas of ESPNdeportes.com during a phone interview that immediate surgery was recommended, and that rehabilitation would take about 10 weeks._

_A source close to the situation told ESPNdeportes.com that the surgery is scheduled for Monday in Colorado._

_There has been no confirmation from the Yankees regarding the scheduled surgery._

_It also means that A-Rod will not be able to participate with the Dominican Republic team in the World Baseball Classic._

_"It's a big blow for the whole family. Alex is destroyed," Joe Rodriguez told ESPNdeportes.com. "We were all very excited to see him play with the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic._

_"But the most important thing is to have a successful surgery so that Alex may continue his career."_

_Stan Javier, general manager of the Dominican Republic's team at the WBC told ESPNdeportes.com: "I haven't received any information on the results of the medical exams performed on A-Rod."_

_Rodriguez felt tightness and stiffness in his right hip this spring and was examined by team physician Dr. Chris Ahmad on Saturday, the Yankees said. An MRI exam showed the cyst._

_Rodriguez then went to be evaluated Wednesday by Dr. Marc Philippon in Vail, Colo. It has been a rough spring for the All-Star third baseman._

_Rodriguez arrived at the Yankees' camp last month in Tampa, Fla., shortly after a report that he had tested positive for steroids in 2003. During a news conference, he admitted he had used performance-enhancing drugs from 2001 to 2003, saying they came from the Dominican and were provided by his cousin._

Part of me really looks at this and wonders... how much of this do you think has to do with the whole steroid/PED issue that he's been dealing with?  (I did check the side effects of steroids... cysts are not listed.)  I'm just wondering if maybe he's been dealing with his sore hip for a little while, and is maybe just taking this opportunity to hide for a bit and catch his breath.

I really need to stop writing about this schmuck.
