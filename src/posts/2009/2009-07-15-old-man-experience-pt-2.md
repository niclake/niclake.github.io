Obviously, when I had my surgery on my wrist/elbow, I kinda had one of those "damn, I'm old" moments.  I just had another one of those about 5 minutes ago.

I've offered to help out some people by doing some web design, and was given a site to look at to see how I wanted to modify it.  As I browsed through the site's code, a realization hit me... I couldn't understand a thing.  Sure, here and there, I can see the linking of pages, images, lists and headers, and so on... but anything more complex than the things I learned in 6th grade?  Gone.  Non-existent.

Needless to say, I'm extremely frustrated right now.
