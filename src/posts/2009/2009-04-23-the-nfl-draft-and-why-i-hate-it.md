ESPN.  Entertainment and Sports Programming Network.  You'd think that maybe they'd cover, you know, sports.  But no, this is Hell Week... aka NFL Draft week.  There's no reason that the draft should get this much coverage.  ESPN doesn't seem to understand that this is the offseason for NFL football.  I swear, there is almost as much football coverage right now as there is during Sept/Oct of the regular season.  Something's not right about that.

You know why I don't give a crap about the draft?  There's a few reasons.

• I like teams that are relatively good (Vikings, Colts).  All this crappy hype that we hear this time of year is routinely about \*THE FIRST TEN FREAKIN' PICKS!!!!\* • My football schools (Iowa, Northern Iowa) don't routinely produce players that go in said first ten freakin' picks (now abbreviated to FTFP for the sake of this article), which means I don't give a crap. • The FTFP, or the entire draft for that matter, is not based on how smart a GM is, or how much money or how many picks that organization is.  The draft (and especially the FTFP) is largely based on luck and guesswork.

You want proof?  Here's the quarterbacks that were taken in the first round of the draft from 1999 to 2005:

Tim Couch, D. McNabb, Akili Smith, D. Culpepper, Cade McNown, Chad Pennington, M. Vick, David Carr, Joey Harrington, Patrick Ramsey, Carson Palmer, Byron Leftwich, Kyle Boller, Rex Grossman, Eli Manning, Philip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, J.P. Losman, Alex Smith, Aaron Rogers, Jason Campbell

Out of all of those, I can only pick 4 names out of there that are outstanding, 1st round worth players (Manning, Rivers, and Big Ben, who all came out in 2004, and Carson Palmer).  McNabb, Culpepper, Vick (pre-jailed version, thanks), and Rogers are really the only other ones that come to mind that are even partway decent.  Pennington has his moments, Leftwich has a lot of potential, and Grossman knows how to give his fans fits.

Earlier today, I was attempting to puncture my eardrums with a rusty spoon as I listened to yet more draft talk, and heard some analysts talking about the 40-yd dash, with all members agreeing "The 40 times are just about the most overrated stat for any up and coming player in the draft".  They then proceed to analyze the  fastest times ran by various players (some WR had a 4.30 40 time) and how it could all translate to their success in the NFL.

/facepalm

Really, the only way it could get any worse is if ESPN decided to add Brett Favre and John Madden to their draft coverage.  Not that I don't like Favre... I respect him a lot, and I'm sure he's got a lot of wisdom he could impart on us all.  No, but rather Madden would spend the entire show slurping Favre's greatness, comparing any up and coming QB to him in his prime, and mumbling senseless mumbo jumbo that would actually make me laugh as opposed to the rest of the repetitive draft coverage that makes me want to cry.

The worst part, is that this draft coverage has been going on for a month now (Todd McShea and Mel Kiper, Jr. make \*all\* their money during this time of year, by the way... which is more money than I'll see in a decade), the draft is Saturday and Sunday, and we won't be done hearing about who did what well and who sucked and how the FTFP are going to fare in their new environments for at least another two weeks.

/facepalm x2

It's things like this that make me lose all faith in humanity, and make me question why I love sports so much.  Then I flip over to WGN to watch Cubs baseball, and things make sense once again.
