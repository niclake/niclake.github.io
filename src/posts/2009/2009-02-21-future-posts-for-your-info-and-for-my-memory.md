Like I said, this is both for your information for what to look for in the near future, as well as a reminder and portable list for me to know what I want to write about.  So, here goes...

- A breakdown of the top players at each position in the MLB (statistically and opinion-based), and possibly the NBA.
- Why Fantasy Sports are so popular, and what to know if you're a new fantasy player
- Recap of some of the best sports rivalries of the past and present
- A day-by-day (and if I get my wish, game-by-game) analysis of the NCAA basketball tournament.  Every game I watch live will surely be written about, and then I may do a recap over highlights/stats for the rest of the games.
- Weekly recaps of the MLB - who's impressive, who's not, and so on.

And most likely, some other things will creep in as well; current events will be the primary topic around here, but I do enjoy recapping or analyzing some things, now that I've had a chance to mull them over a bit.

Got an idea?  [Shoot me an e-mail](mailto:w2pb.mail@gmail.com?subject=Idea for Blog) and I'll see what I can do.  If I don't write about it, I'll happily shoot you an e-mail back explaining why, and possibly giving you a few personal thoughts about the topic.

Also, for those of you that are reading this blog... thank you so much.  It's far more popular than I imagined it would be initially, and I'm finding myself truly enjoying writing all these posts.  Your comments and feedback are always appreciated as well.

Cheers,
