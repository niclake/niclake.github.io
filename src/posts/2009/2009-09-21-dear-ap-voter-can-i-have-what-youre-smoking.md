Raise your hands here if you like the BCS and the way it's set up.

Go ahead, find your friends that support it.  I'll wait.

It's about time that someone who actually has some power regarding the BCS and its rankings stepped up and made a statement about it, and [I'm glad that the Orlando Sentinel is willing to let someone write about it](http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college/2009/09/ap-voter-houston-and-cincinnati-among-four-teams-better-than-florida.html).  Doug Lesmerises of the Cleveland Plain Dealer turned in this wonderful ballot for the AP poll.

First of all, thanks, Doug, for giving Iowa way more credit than they deserve.  Every little ego boost they can get helps.

Really, though, did this guy do anything wrong?  The polls (and those who vote on them) are reflecting not necessarily has happened in the season, but what voters assume \*will\* happen.  I'm sorry, but Florida has beaten who exactly?  Texas?  Or what about USC, ranked at #25 in this guy's poll?  I mean, they did lose to a team that won no games last year (though that is taking last season into account... oops).

I hope that this story gets some wide-spread coverage... and then I hope the other voters man up and vote the way they should, for the best team at that particular moment in time, reflected not on thoughts or feelings but on facts and stats.  The BCS is an absolute travesty, and Division I-A college football is the only sport in which the champion is not determined by a playoff.  That's not fair to the fans, the conferences, or the players on the team that pour their heart and soul into the classroom sport that they love so much.

Look, I'm not saying Florida doesn't deserve their top ranking, that USC is only the 25th ranked team, that Houston deserves to be 3rd... none of that.  I \*do\* think that the way these polls are established are flawed, and that the conception of the BCS and all the bowl games aren't about crowning the greatest teams, but rather about making the most money.  I understand the economics behind that, but when it comes to the fans of the sport, we're all being jipped.  And we all know it.  And when the BCS contract is up (I believe 2011?), the fans want change.

Or else.
