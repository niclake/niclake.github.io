That's right, you heard me.  The Best Day in Sports.  Usually, at least.

Today was a bit of a letdown.  I woke up expecting to see the Red Sox smacking some baseballs around, but of course, El Niño had to rear  its ugly head again, and caused a handful of rain/snow-outs today.  I felt amazingly attached to almost every game I watched, however, due to the fact that my Fantasy Baseball team is spread around so much.  Of course, I pick up Jarrod Saltalamacchia because he's got a cool name, but I don't start him... and from my bench, he goes 2/4, with 2 runs, 3 RBI, and 1 HR.  Gwar.

And then the Cubs.  Ah, the Cubs.  I really don't know how to feel about this team.  Part of me thinks that this is their year, that they're unstoppable and all that... but then I remember who we are talking about.  No matter.  Chicago put the foot down today from the start, as Soriano cranked out an early HR,  and they won 4-2.  (Also, I remembered one of the very few reasons I hate ESPN... and that's their Monday Night Baseball blackouts.  Seriously, the game is \*AT\* Houston.  There's no way I can get there and see it.  Thank goodness for WGN/Comcast.)

And the Yankees.  Well, I got a good smile out of that game.  CC Sabathia got shelled pretty good, and he showed some definite command issues on opening day.  The Orioles showed a great trend for baseball that I hope is going to be league-wide this year; speed, small ball, baserunning, and good defense.  Obviously, they gave up a bunch of runs to the powerful Yankees, but you'll have that... it's just a matter of not trying to swing for the fences to get a run back on every pitch.  Izturis lifted one over the wall, but that was even close.  And Adam Jones (Baltimore CF) showed me a lot today... sure, it's only the first day, but look for this guy to produce at the plate and in the field this season.

NCAA Championship?  I watched about 2 minutes of it total.  UNC won.  Whoopee.  Mr. President, you were correct.  I hope your foreign policy is as good as your bracket guessing.

Tomorrow... Ryan Dempster takes the mound for the Cubs, and the Red Sox (I think) play a doubleheader to make up for today.  More great baseball, in amidst me turning in a plethora of job applications.
