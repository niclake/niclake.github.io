![](images/lakers0229.jpg)You know what's kind of refreshing right now?

Think about this: When you watch Sportscenter, and you see a Miami Heat highlight, who do they talk about?  Dwayne Wade.  What about the Cavaliers?  It's all about LeBron James.  Suns?  Shaq's usually the one making the noise?  Lakers?  Ko...

Wait a second.

Tonight,  I just watched the highlights of the Lakers game.  They only showed 2nd half highlights, but Kobe Bryant was mentioned  once... and that was a pass to Farmar, who passed the ball down low.  Granted, with top spot locked, he's not getting as much media attention or playing time, but when have you really seen Bryant as the face/focus of a Lakers highlight lately?

Odom.  Walton.  Turiaf.  Farmar.  Gasol.  Ariza.  Fisher.  Vujacic.  And don't forget about Bynum, who just made his return from his injury earlier in the season.  I saw all of those guys making shots, passes, playing defense, getting open, and all the small things that makes a complete basketball team.  And barely any mention of Kobe.

Now, I'll be honest.  I used to like Kobe Bryant.  I'm a Shaq fan, and when Shaq was with the Lakers, Kobe was the chain holding up the bling.  Nowadays, I respect him as a star in the NBA.  Where James is about power in the east, Kobe is about finesse in the west.  It's fun to check out some of the highlights, but for years, all I've seen is Kobe Kobe Kobe oh look Gasol Kobe Kobe Kobe hey Bynum is back! Kobe Kobe Kobe.

Kobe.

Now, with highlights tonight, I really don't know what to do with myself.  It's like Pavlov's dog, only now there's no food \*or\* a bell.  I'm just supposed to salivate by seeing the Lakers on a highlight?  Can't do it.  But here they are, destroying playoff teams while resting some of their starters.

Here's the highlights. Bynum dunk. Kobe layup. Jazz. Odom layup. Bynum dunk. Kobe drive and shot off the glass. Kobe 3 pointer.

Now granted, this is a different cut of the highlights, but they showed 7 of Bryant's 16 points.  16.  The Lakers scored 125 points.  There was more emphasis on Odom's little spats with Daron Williams than there was on Bryant.  They're playing like a \*team\*, which is something you don't find anywhere else with an elite star right now.  Heat?  Wade carries them.  Same with the Cavs, though LeBron does have some decent role players.  The Celtics are loaded with talent all over, and have 3 huge stars (with one on the rise in Rondo).  Even Michael Jordan carried his franchise most of the time. 

I guess the question is... will this continue during the playoffs, or will it become Phil's Kobe-Triangle offense again?
