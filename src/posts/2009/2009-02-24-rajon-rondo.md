I was talking to a friend of mine today about Rondo and the Celtics, and I have a profound statement to say.

- \*IF\* Rondo learns/develops his 3 point shot,
- \*IF\* he stays with the Celtics organization for a prolonged period of time (10 years or so),
- \*IF\* the Celtics manage to keep their core (Allen, Pierce, KG) together for a while (at least 3, 4 years),
- \*IF\* the Celtics can maintain a solid bench for 8 of those 10 years, and
- \*IF\* the Celtics use their draft picks wisely

Rajon Rondo has the potential to become the greatest point guard of all time.

Now, I realize this is a ton of ifs, and that many players show this kind of potential (I'm looking at you, Chris Paul).  However, Rondo has the team, the organization with the mystique, and is developing his skill set at such a high rate of speed, that he is my current pick as "Best Point Guard" in the NBA right now.

 

I think this is the week that I lose my credibility for making so many profound statements when it comes to sports; first my [insane prediction about  MLB 2nd basemen](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/mlb-analysis-2nd-basemen/), then [managing to forget JoePa's name](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/ncaa-season-rankings/) for a few minutes (thanks, Shawn), now this.
