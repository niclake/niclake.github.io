So this evening, thanks to my buddy Bennett, I discovered that I have, in fact, made it big time.  Ladies and gentlemen... I'm in a music video.

The band: Relient K The song: Devastation and Reform The venue: OneFest 2006 The video:

URGH!  Stupid YouTube not allowing me to embed the video on the site.  Here's the link... [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_w8FVBr5M-s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w8FVBr5M-s)

If you're impatient, scroll to about the 1:27 mark of the video (if you pause it, then move the slider, you'll find it easier).  Look in the lower left hand of the video, and you'll see a guy with short brown hair holding something in front of his face.  That's me, and that's my camera.  Also, at the 2:53 mark, I'm the face in the bottom right corner.

Want proof?  Here are some of the shots I took while I was there.

Clicking on any of the pictures will shoot you to my DeviantArt gallery (that hasn't been updated in a long time, but hey, I do what I can).

This makes me extremely happy.  That was the first of 2 times that I've seen Relient K in concert, and both were excellent shows.  OneFest in general was just epic.

Ok, enough happiness.  Bedtime.
