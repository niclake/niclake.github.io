Word out of NY is that A-Fraud has been benched for "fatigue".  I see two options...

1) He's worn out because he doesn't have steroids keeping him going, or 2) Madonna's been wearing him out too much.

Either option doesn't bode well once the NY media gets ahold of it.

Hey Fraudriguez... talk to Manny.  He'll tell you about the success of **WOMEN'S FERTILITY DRUGS** and how well they work for you.
