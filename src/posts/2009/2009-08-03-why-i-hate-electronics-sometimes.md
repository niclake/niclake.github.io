I set an alarm to go off on my computer at midnight on July 31st.  That was the day Nine Inch Nails tickets went on sale.  For those that don't know, NIN (or Trent Reznor, if you will) is doing their/his last tour at the end of August/beginning of September.  I was hoping to snag some tickets to one of the Chicago shows.

Well, 2 things were working against me here...

1) Tickets sold out \*insanely\* fast.  The pre-sale tickets for the NIN club members?  All of them, for all venues, gone in 1 minute.  That's not a typo... 2) (and the point of this article) Computers, especially computers that I own, apparently enjoy paying me back for taxing them on a daily basis by not working properly for important, time-sensitive things.  This was apparently one of those cases.

Needless to say, it being the last tour and all, by the time I remembered to check for tickets, they were all gone.  eBay scalpers are selling the tickets now at around $250-300 per... I'm kinda pissed off at this.
