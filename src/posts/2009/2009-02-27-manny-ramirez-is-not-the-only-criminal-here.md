_PHOENIX --_ [_Manny Ramirez_](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=2974) _has rejected yet another offer from the_ [_Los Angeles Dodgers_](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/clubhouse?team=lad)_._

_The Dodgers announced Thursday night **the star outfielder's agent Scott Boras had declined a $25 million, one-year contract** with a $20 million player option for 2010. It was the club's fourth offer to Ramirez this offseason._

_"We want Manny back, but we feel we are negotiating against ourselves," Dodgers owner Frank McCourt said in a statement. "When his agent finds those 'serious offers' from other clubs, we'll be happy to restart the negotiations."_

_General manager Ned Colletti and McCourt met Wednesday in Los Angeles with Boras._

_The offer is similar to the two-year, $45 million deal with a buyout or club option that the Dodgers put on the table in November. Ramirez refused the offer and the Dodgers withdrew their proposal. The team came back with a one-year, $25 million offer, but Ramirez turned that down as well. Ramirez also turned down salary arbitration._

_"Even with an economy that has substantially eroded since last November, out of respect for Manny and his talents, we actually improved our offer," McCourt said._

_"So now, we start from scratch."_

_A message left with Boras was not immediately returned._

_**Colletti said there was not necessarily a hard deadline, and that Ramirez was not yet needed in spring training.**_

I believe that there are 2 very important lessons to be learned here.

1. The Dodgers haven't gotten wise to the "Manny being Manny" thing yet.  As a Red Sox fan throughout the entire era, let me tell you... it sucks.  I was on enough of an emotional roller coaster in high school... I don't really want another one again.  He hits, he crawls to first.  He makes a fantastic catch in the outfield, he throw the ball past the cutoff man.  He hustles, he... well, doesn't hustle.  The Dodgers are trying to hold all the cards here, which I think would reign in the antics slightly, but they're still getting hosed by...
2. Scott Boras.  There's big reason why he is the "Anti-Christ of Baseball" and is hated so strongly by so many organizations across the majors.  Boras currently represents 63 players in the majors, most of whom are high-profile, high-caliber, and highly-paid.  My question is this... it says "\[Boras\] has declined the ...offer" in the AP press release.  Did he even consult Manny?  Does Manny know that no one really wants a cancer on their team?  (Well, maybe... the Knicks just carved one out, so maybe you could give basketball a shot.)

I got a kick out of Frank McCourt's quote from the article above... "When his agent finds those 'serious offers' from other clubs, we'll be happy to restart the negotiations."  Boras continues to claim that someone is interested in him.  Who?  The Yankees?  No, they've spent millions already.  The Giants?  Didn't they just ditch an aging, controversial left fielder?  The Marlins?  Not at your asking price.  Boston?

Sorry.  I had to take a break while I got all the chuckles out of my system.

The only thing I don't want to see more than Manny getting signed, is Manny turning into the next Roger Clemens... i.e. showing up in May/June while speculation plagues the newsstands for weeks, wondering when he's going to get signed.  Either sign the contract (which apparently is withdrawn now... hopefully the Dodgers are done), or go home and enjoy all the money you made.

There was no hitter more frightening to pitchers than Manny Ramirez in his prime.  [Curt Schilling even admitted](http://38pitches.weei.com/general/20-random-things-from-our-baseball-life/) that he's the most dominant he ever played with (#7).  But back then, your antics were fun, humorous, and relatively good natured.  When you can't remember which knee you've been limping around on for a few weeks, methinks it's time to hang it up.
