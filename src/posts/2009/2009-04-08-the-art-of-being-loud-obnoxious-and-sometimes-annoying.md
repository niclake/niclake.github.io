![](images/Baseball_umpire_2004.jpg)Don't get me wrong.  I love baseball.  I love everything about the sport; it's got tradition, it's got a modern touch, it's got numbers, and it makes you think.  Really, there's no other sport like it, other than golf... but golf is "even more boring than baseball" (except for this coming weekend, but that's beside the point).

But there is one thing that I sometimes cannot stand about baseball.  That, my readers, is the home plate umpire.

Now, often, the only time people really think about umpires is when they blow a call... Ed Hochuli comes to mind from last season's San Diego Chargers blown call (wrong sport, but you get my point).  Baseball, however, has a whole different breed... the loud ones.  We have the simple guys that just point and say "strike".  We have the guys that are calm and collected 90% of the time, except on a called strike three, when suddenly they spring into action and try to uppercut the Ghost of Christmas Past with a solid left.

And then, we have Jim Joyce.

Jim Joyce is an outstanding umpire.  He calls great games, and has a very consistent, by-the-rules strike zone.  But that's not why his name sticks out in my mind.

If you're a Cubs fan, then you're probably watching Jim Joyce call the game for the Cubs/Astros game this evening.  As the announcers put it in the first, "Jim Joyce wants everyone in the ballpark to know when he makes a strike call".  And he does too.  As I sit here and type this, I find myself getting a bit of tunnel vision... and then suddenly, I'm yanked out of it by a strike call from my television.

Now, I understand that calling a baseball game is an art form, but really, this is about as unnecessary as the tennis pros screaming every time they hit a ball.  (I recall a time watching a women's tennis match where someone screamed at the top of their lungs as they put an effortless drop shot over the net... that was actually good strategy, cause it completely fooled her opponent... but I digress.)  It doesn't take anything away from the game at all, but it sure does get pretty annoying pretty quickly.  When they swing, do you yell?  No... just when they stand there looking foolish.  Not only does the batter feel stupid for not swinging at that particular meatball, but then their unprotected back ear is suddenly shattered by the deafening sound that... well, really, it's just an unintelligible war cry (they claim to be saying "strike", but you could say the same thing about karate masters putting a fist through 16 concrete blocks).

In short... I realize how non-rewarding being an umpire or referee can be, but there's a reason for that... they are paid to make the calls when needed, and to be "in the background" the rest of the time.  Please, MLB Umps, I like my ears.  I have a hard enough time hearing as it is.  Once is funny.  Twice is alright.  More than that... eh.
