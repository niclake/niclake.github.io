![](images/masters06previo2-10.jpg)Have I ever mentioned that I love this week in sports?

- Opening Night/Day of baseball
- NCAA Basketball championship (lackluster, but still)
- NBA Playoff pushes (or chokes... yes you, Phoenix)
- The Masters

This list is in no particular order... ok, I lied.  Baseball is rightfully first, even though managing a fantasy team is going to give me an aneurysm.  But the Masters... how can you not have that rated high on your list?  Even if you're not a golf fan, if there's any tournament that you watch, this is probably it.

The Masters has it all... the drama, the excitement, the risks and satisfaction, as well as the gambles and heartbreak, all in one weekend.  There's great stories almost every year (Gary Player teeing off for the 52nd and final time, for example), and usually excitement on every Sunday.  I remember when I was younger, I'd turn on the TV after church and notice golf of all things.  Usually that would be when I'd go ride my bike or something, but there was one guy that really changed my mentality on this sport.

Guess who... yeah, I know... cliché.  But ta da, Tiger Woods arrived on the scene, and completely revolutionized (as well as commercialized) the sport of golf.  Personally, I think Tiger has a very arrogant attitude, or at least comes off that way in his interviews... but he has a right to be.  He currently is, hands down, the most dominating player of any sport.  No Federer, no LeBron James, no one.

![](images/The+Masters+Final+Round+08k-_qorkpJl.jpg)The most epic things I've ever witnessed in sports?  Tiger Woods winning a major on a broken leg/torn ACL.  On his plant leg.  I just saw some footage on ESPN showing the difference in his left leg from 07, 08, and 09.  07, he was kinda loose.  08, when he was injured, he put hardly any weight on his leg, and his accuracy and power suffered.  From the images so far this year, his stance is tighter, and his plant leg just plain doesn't move.

Think about it.  Tiger was wounded so severely that there's no reason he should've even been walking around.  Yet what did he do?  He tore the crap out of the field, toughed it out, and won the major.  Jordan's "I had the flu and we won" moment is the only thing that I can even think of that's kinda close to this.  I say kinda because, to be honest, Tiger's performance is leaps and bounds ahead of that Jordan moment.

Tiger dominates in the most popular  solo sport there is right now.  Tennis comes close, but golf is still far more difficult week to week.  Sports like basketball, baseball, football... they all have their stars, but every player would much rather have a championship than a personal achievement (I take that back... I'm sure there's some people out there that go for their own gain).  Tiger is competing against not only the weather, the course, or all the other players on tour every week, but he competes in order to continue to carry the weight of the sports world on his shoulders.  You know that there's something special about a guy when the ESPN Question of the Night is "Who will win the 2009 Masters, Tiger or the field?"  Really?  It reminds me of that TV show 1 vs 100 (I never watched it), except the 1 has an absolute stranglehold on every single other member of that 100.

That, or he just uses his driver and whacks them all in the kneecaps.  Do you know how bad that hurts?  :-\\

I, personally, am taking and rooting for Tiger.  If there's anyone that deserves every win week to week more than him, please point them out to me.
