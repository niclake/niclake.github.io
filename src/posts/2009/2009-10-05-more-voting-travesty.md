I've already talked about this topic once, and I'm going to have to say it again...

The NCAA polls should not be based on speculation.  They should be based purely on performance.

![](images/4c4120e3-baec-4dea-9a42-1c5f95147827.jpg)That being said... [why is Oklahoma ranked 19th](http://espn.go.com/college-football/rankings/_/poll/1/week/6)?  They have a 2-2 record.  Every ranked team they've played so far (20th ranked BYU and 17th ranked Miami), they've lost to.  Some will argue that they've only lost by a total of 2 points, but last I checked, a loss is a loss.  Their wins?  Idaho State and Tulsa, by a combined score of 109-0.  Yeah, that's right... big bad Oklahoma gets to walk all over a Big Sky and a Conference USA opponent.

"Oh, but they don't have Sam Bradford, and as soon as they do, they'll be even better."  So?  Wait until he comes back then.  Until then, take your drubbings and get the hell out of my top 25.  The way Oklahoma has played as a team thus far, they don't deserve to be ranked.

Want to know who they're ranked ahead of (in case you didn't look)? Mississippi, Nebraska, Georgia Tech, 5-0 South Florida, 5-0 Missouri, and South Carolina.  Wisconsin is the first team out of the rankings right now.  While Wisconsin doesn't necessarily have the most ideal of records (having to take Fresno State into overtime, and other victories against Northern Illinois and Woford), they are 2-0 in the Big Ten against the Michigan State and Minnesota, and more importantly, are 5-0 overall.

"But Nic, you're an Iowa fan.  They don't deserve to be #12... that's just a bias."  You're right.  They don't deserve it.  I'm honestly surprised that they didn't slip down in the rankings... they only moved up because of Houston and Oklahoma sliding down (or out) of the top 25.  The only positive thing that came out of the Iowa game was knowing that the Hawkeyes have the potential to start quickly, and that McNutt is in fact a viable option at wide receiver, instead of just a glorified roster spot for a one-time quarterback.  They've pulled out squeakers against Northern Iowa (I'll get back to this in just a second) and Arkansas State.  First of all, I have never heard of Arkansas State before.  Ever.  In theory, that should mean a giant smackdown of a football game, and we seemed to start off that way with 2 quick TDs.  And then, next thing I know, I'm getting text updates from 4Info.com and seeing that ArkSt has the ball, down by 3, with under a minute to go... gwauh?!?

[Northern Iowa, on the other hand, is a very legitimate team](http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=cfoot2/misc/tsn-div-1aa-poll.htm).  FCS, sure, whatever... but #3 in the FCS.  A little home-town, alma mater bias (I guess I haven't graduated yet, so it's still "current school" status)... UNI is an incredibly good football team.  Should Iowa have won that game by more than 1 point?  Yep.  Was I really surprised that they didn't?  Not really.

I think [Doug Lesmerises' picks](http://www.cleveland.com/buckeyeblog/index.ssf/2009/10/doug_lesmerises_top_25_ap_ball.html) are more and more sane every week.  Why he used to have Iowa as a #5, I'm really not sure... but everything he writes about makes at least a little sense.  I'm glad to see someone actually challenging the polls week in and week out, and not just conforming to society and the big-name schools.
