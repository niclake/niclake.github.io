Before I begin, I want to make something very clear.  I enjoy Cubs baseball.  Yes, I'm a die-hard Red Sox fan, but as a midwesterner, I've found room in my heart to let the Loveable Losers of Baseball(tm) make a small home.  I mean, come on, WGN or Comcast shows their games practically every day... if I need a baseball fix, what better place to turn?  And besides, I am of the belief that there is absolutely no problem having a favorite team from each league (Red Sox/Cubs, Vikings/Colts, Celtics/Suns for me), so long as those teams avoid each other during the post season.  So, with that being said, it is with absolute glee that I am able to go into this next story.

![](images/milton-bradley-chicago-cubs.jpg)According to ESPNChicago, Milton Bradley has been suspended for the remainder of the season.  The move came after he made comments to the Arlington Heights Daily Herald, stating that Chicago is "just not a positive environment.  I need a stable healthy, enjoyable environment... It's just negativity."

For those of you that don't have a Cubs fan in your life, let me share with you some things about Milton.  Milton is the guy that tore his ACL in '07 while trying to yell at an umpire and being restrained by his first base coach, and in the subsequent week his Padres fell out of the division lead and ended off losing a one-game playoff to the Rockies.  Milton is (one of) the guy(s) that caught a routine fly ball in the outfield, then turned and tossed the ball into the stands... when there were only 2 outs.  Routine flys seem to land all around this guy constantly, and there's a lack of hustle that Chicago fans aren't used to seeing out of right fielders wearing number 21.

Maybe he should've corked his bat... people aren't used to seeing star athletes hitting .257 when they're making $7 million either.  But I digress.

This guy is honestly just a cancer for every team he has played for over his 10 years in the majors.  While he's definitely had some serious baseball talent over his career, his attitude and actions this season have resulted in a steady chorus of boos from the Cubs fans since the very beginning of the season.  He's been suspended for bumping umpires, made some boneheaded plays, had nearly as many strikeouts as he has hits (95 to 101), and is generally just a thorn in the side of all the Wrigley faithful.

His last 10 games?  Playing against the Mets, Pirates, Reds, and Brewers... dude's had 35 at bats, with 5 hits, 2 runs, 1 RBI, 0 walks, and 12 strikeouts.  He dropped 8 points from his batting average, going from a .265 to a .257.  "Well, he's got a bum knee."  Then why is he playing, when the Cubs still have some small glimmering of a chance of making the playoffs?  (No, I don't think they'll make it... 8 out with 15 to go is a bit insane to hope on, but stranger things have happened.)

Look, Milton Bradley can play baseball, there's no doubt about that.  He's never been outstanding, but he's been able to churn out stats worthy enough of making a majority of the teams in the league.  That's why he was signed to a 3-year, $30m contract.  If the guy would just pick up his bat and glove, keep his head in the game, and keep his mouth shut, life would be super.

So Bradley is most likely on his way out of Chicago... there's something about these historic sports cities that doesn't bode well to trying to repair troublemakers, and Bradley isn't nearly worth the time or effort required to rectify the situation.  The question is, are the Cubs going to be able to trade him away, or is this going to be a case where they have to eat some salary and just drop him from the roster?  A long offseason awaits the Cubs, so we shall have to wait and see.
