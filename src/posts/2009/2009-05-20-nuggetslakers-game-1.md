I'll admit, I didn't watch all of this game... I really need 2 TVs.  I was flipping between the game, NHL, and Deadliest Warrior on Spike.

Anyway, what I did see can be summed up as follows: (Written over the course of the last 5 minutes of the game)

Melo: A more effective weapon than I think anyone ever gave him credit for.  With 3:25 left, he has 39 points on 14-20 shooting.  80% 3-pointers.  7-8 from the free throw line.  6 boards, 4 assists, only 2 turnovers.  Rising to the challenge of playing head to head with Kobe... it's great to watch.

Kobe: Only 32 points on 12-26 shooting (ended with 40 on 13-28 shooting).  Honestly trying to do too much.  The Lakers are there because of team play, but Kobe is reminding me of an old college dorm-mate that wouldn't pass the ball once he got it, unless someone jumped on his back.  He calmed down after that 3:25 timeout, made a great pass to Fish in the corner for a wide open shot.  Early though... tons of forced shots that went wanting.

Chauncey: 18 points, 8 assists, 5 boards.  One of the best single-player trades (for Iverson) that I've ever witnessed, and he's helped them get this far.

Jones/Martin/Nené: Outstanding.  Role players to the core.  I should add Smith and Birdman to this list too.  They step up and contribute, and play with heart.  Martin has made a couple of "let him take it" shots that are killing the Lakers.

Lakers Not Named Kobe, Gasol, or Fisher: If you continue to not show up, the Nuggets will continue to walk all over you.

Nuggets as a team: Hustle, heart, and good defense on Kobe.  Appears to be lacking the killer mentality that comes with experience in the playoffs.

Also, to all you broadcasters/sports talk people... \*please\* learn how to pronounce Nené's name correctly.  It's not "Nay-nay"... it's "Nuh-nay".  Research, people.

 

![](images/Lebron-James-and-Carmelo-Anthony---04-All-Star-Game---Posed-Photofile-Photograph-C10121539.jpeg)Remember when Melo was drafted, and all the talk was "LeBron vs. Carmelo"?  LeBron soared into the spotlight in the east, while Melo kinda faded from view.  To be honest, I didn't think much about him since his suspension for drunk driving.  Now here he is, on the big stage, against Kobe and the Lakers, terrors of the west.

Jalen Rose just responded to a re-tweet of mine on Twitter (posted by Jen at [stilettosetsports.com/](http://www.stilettosetsports.com/), a site which I assist with)... 

> **StilettoSportsJ** - RT @niclake13: @jalenrose How unbelievably underrated do you think Melo is? **jalenrose** -@stilettosportsj all star and olympian- shoe deal and commercials-mag covers and interviews..he gets his love!Win postseason-get more love

All the talk right now is how we want to see LeBron vs. Kobe... I think either of these Western teams will make the finals wonderful.

In the end... Kobe shows up, does what he always does, the Lakers show killer instinct, Melo doesn't score in the last 3:25, and J.R. Smith goes down on the final free throw with what I'm going to call a sprained \_CL (A or M, I don't know).  He'll be out or very limited for game 2.

The Nuggets know what's up now.  Down 0-1.  Let the war begin.
