![](images/blowingthewhistle.jpg)So tonight, I decided that I wanted to write a nice little article about the NBA.  I figured I'd talk about who I thought had the best chances to win (I'm guessing Spurs/Lakers in the West, and Cavs/Celtics in the East... but don't count out the Magic, or even the Nuggets this season), how I'm actually excited to watch the NBA for the first time in a long time... you know, something positive.  I mean, think about it.  We have all these high-profile stars being traded everywhere, tons of stars that have expiring contracts and want to make the best possible impressions... this has the potential to be an amazing NBA season.

And then I checked my RSS reader.

I had 2 stories that really caught my eye out of my "most read feeds" section.  The first was about [how Tim Donaghy's book](http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4603209&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines) _[Blowing the Whistle](http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4603209&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines)_ [was being yanked by the publisher](http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4603209&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines) (courtesy of ESPN), as well as some [more in-depth reasoning behind it](http://deadspin.com/5392030/the-book-the-nba-doesnt-want-you-to-read) (courtesy of Deadspin.com).  The second was [actual excerpts from the book](http://deadspin.com/5392067/excerpts-from-the-book-the-nba-doesnt-want-you-to-read) (more Deadspin).

Regarding the book being yanked, here's an excerpt from Deadspin:

> About 10 months ago, \[Donaghy\] shopped the book to Triumph Books, an imprint of Random House, according to a source close to Donaghy. Triumph, the source says, "put forth a huge effort to verify every statement in that book." (Triumph's editorial director, Tom Bast, declined to comment.) Two weeks ago, _Blowing the Whistle_ was ready for printing; _60 Minutes_ had plans to interview Donaghy in conjunction with the book's publication. Then the NBA came calling. "They came after Random House and threatened a lawsuit," the source says, "and Random House just rolled and decided to not go with it. It's really that simple." **To his knowledge, no one at the NBA had actually read the book**.
> 
> "Which is why," he goes on, "Triumph was so intrigued as to why the parent company decided to not go with it. Because there was no logical reasoning other than an open threat. It just doesn't make sense. If they had come down and said, 'There are some specific things that are flat-out lies or they're wrong and we think there are fabrications or something,' then there'd be some basis to say, 'OK, we need to back up and double-check this.' But this was just an open comment. And so we don't know what the specific basis of that potential suit might've been."
> 
> The book no longer has an Amazon page; it's [cached here](http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:o3XlMXYhHW0J:www.amazon.com/Blowing-Whistle-Culture-Fraud-Nba/dp/1600783465+%22blowing+the+whistle%22+donaghy+book+triumph&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a). Meanwhile, Donaghy is looking for another publisher. He may even self-publish. "It's dead right now," the source says. "The whole thing has fallen flat on its face. ... Obviously, the NBA has got some people running scared."

And here's exactly why I think this book should be published... an actual excerpt from the book, talking about Dick Bavetta being the self-proclaimed "go-to" referee for the NBA in big time moments.

> The 2002 series certainly wasn't the first or last time \[Dick\] Bavetta weighed in on an important game. He also worked Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and the Trail Blazers. The Lakers were down by 13 at the start of the fourth quarter when Bavetta went to work. The Lakers outscored Portland 31–13 in the fourth quarter and went on to win the game and the series. It certainly didn't hurt the Lakers that they got to shoot 37 free throws compared to a paltry 16 for the Trail Blazers.
> 
> Two weeks before the 2003–04 season ended, Bavetta and I were assigned to officiate a game in Oakland. That afternoon before the tip-off, we were discussing an upcoming game on our schedule. It was the last regular-season game we were scheduled to work, pitting Denver against San Antonio. Denver had lost a game a few weeks prior because of a mistake made by the referees, a loss that could be the difference between them making or missing the playoffs. Bavetta told me Denver needed the win and that it would look bad for the staff and the league if the Nuggets missed the playoffs by one game. There were still a few games left on the schedule before the end of the season, and the standings could potentially change. But on that day in Oakland, Bavetta looked at me and casually stated, "Denver will win if they need the game. That's why I'm on it."
> 
> I was thinking, How is Denver going to win on the road in San Antonio? At the time, the Spurs were arguably the best team in the league. Bavetta answered my question before it was asked.
> 
> "Duncan will be on the bench with three fouls within the first five minutes of the game," he calmly stated.
> 
> Bavetta went on to inform me that it wasn't the first time the NBA assigned him to a game for a specific purpose. He cited examples, including the 1993 playoff series when he put New Jersey guard Drazen Petrovic on the bench with quick fouls to help Cleveland beat the Nets. He also spoke openly about the 2002 Los Angeles–Sacramento series and called himself the NBA's "go-to guy."
> 
> As it turned out, Denver didn't need the win after all; they locked up a spot in the playoffs before they got to San Antonio. In a twist of fate, it was the Spurs that ended up needing the win to have a shot at the division title, and Bavetta generously accommodated. In our pregame meeting, he talked about how important the game was to San Antonio and how meaningless it was to Denver, and that San Antonio was going to get the benefit of the calls that night. Armed with this inside information, I called Jack Concannon before the game and told him to bet the Spurs.
> 
> To no surprise, we won big. San Antonio blew Denver out of the building that evening, winning by 26 points. When Jack called me the following morning, he expressed amazement at the way an NBA game could be manipulated. Sobering, yes; amazing, no. That's how the game is played in the National Basketball Association.

There's many out there that wonder how true some of these allegations are... some of this stuff is just too difficult to make up, in my mind.  I'm really bummed now that this book has been yanked... if any of this stuff is true, I hope that David Stern, as well as all of the commissioners of every sports league, are taking a good hard look at their staff, from the front offices to the medical staff (with all the NFL talks about concussions and the team doctors clearing players) and the umpires/referees.  It amazes me that Stern looks at these claims as, and I quote, "baseless"... makes you wonder if he's in on it too.
