Obviously, I'm a huge sports nut.  Basketball, baseball, soccer, football, hockey, rugby, jai alai (yeah, it was on once)... anything that I can possibly watch, I usually do.  Unscripted drama at every turn, excitement, and (usually) non-stop action.  What's not to love about it.

But I do have my other vices as well.  About 2 years ago during my annoyances with my concussion, I discovered the Food Network.  There's nothing worse than watching Iron Chef America at 1 am when all you have to eat in your room is a package or Ramen Noodles.

And now lately, I've been addicted to the Discovery Channel.  I don't often know half the shows that I'm watching, but there's obviously the old standby, Mythbusters.  I've also discovered Smash Lab, which apparently has a marathon running as I type this.

Now if only FX played new movies... I'm sick of Hellboy, The Day After Tomorrow, and all the other movies they've shown about 30 billion times...
