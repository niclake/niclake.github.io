Seriously, what is the big to-do about scary movies?  I don't get it.

I got asked to watch "The Orphan" last night.  Not necessarily what some people would consider to be a "scary" movie, but the general concept is the same.  \*\*\*SPOILER WARNING\*\*\* The whole concept of the movie is about a little girl who was adopted by a family, and ends off causing all sorts of trouble for everyone, including killing a couple of characters and attempting to kill 2 more.  Eventually, you find out that she's not really a little girl at all. \*\*\*SPOILER ENDING\*\*\*

I guess when you stop and think about it, scary movies aren't really different than a lot of military films that are released nowadays.  Both manage to surprise the hell out of you.  Both usually manage to depict some very gruesome and violent acts.  I think that what makes the military movies more "acceptable" on that front is the fact that these things actually happen all the time in wars, whereas the scary movie's violence is usually murder or torture of some kind.

And then we have the Saw movies.  6 movies based upon a psychopath attempting to "better people's lives" by putting them through "tests".  A guy's head is trapped in a glass box that's slowly filling with water; he's forced to give himself a tracheotomy in order to keep alive while rescuers come.  In another, 2 people are attempting to get out of a room, and are forced to drain their bodies of 10 pints of blood by getting their arms slashed with circular saws.  In another, a guy crushes his hands on purpose in pneumatic presses, hoping to avoid being cut in half by a pendulum blade.  He didn't, and was chopped in half.

Why do we as a society even go to these movies?  I watch movies to be entertained, not to be grossed out or scared.  For example... I remember going to see "Scary Movie" with Zach and his mom back when it was in theaters.  It's basically a parody movie along the lines of Austin Powers, in which pretty much every stereotype imaginable from scary movies was explored and made fun of.  To this day, probably one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen... but I laughed and I was entertained, so that counts for something, I guess.

And no, I'm not a wuss.
