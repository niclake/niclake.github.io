So I want to tell you a little game about a football game.

Today, I had excellent seats for the Iowa/Indiana football game at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City.  And by excellent... well, 8 rows up, on the 46 yard line behind the Iowa bench.  Yeah, they're good.  8-0 Iowa was taking on 4-4 Indiana, one of two teams that's notorious for giving Iowa fits on occasion (the other being Northwestern, who Iowa plays next week).  Obviously, we had some expectations for a massive blowout.  The spread was 17.5 points today.  We'd cover that, right?

Not the way we thought...

Indiana got the ball right away, and marched straight down the field.  11 plays, 69 yards, 5:01, 7 points.  Iowa proceeds to get the ball on a great kick return, march down the field, 9 plays, and miss a field goal.  Great.

Then we get into the turnover drought.  INT at 1:16 of the 1st quarter.  Trading punts, including an 8 yard shank by our outstanding punter Donahue.  Trading TDs (now down 14-7).  Giving up another TD right before the end of the 1st half because our punt returner picked up a bouncing kick and couldn't hold on to the football.  Down 21-7.  Obviously things aren't looking good.  It was so quiet late in the 2nd, you could clearly hear players on the field.  Deathly quiet.

Iowa takes the kick to start the 2nd half.  5 plays, and an INT.  Next drive, 3 plays and an INT.  Indiana drives down to the 2 yard line.  And then... the game changer.  If you've watched Sportscenter already, you've seen the play.  The ball gets punched out of the Indiana QB's hands, hits 2 Indiana players and 2 Iowa players before settling into Tyler Sash's hands, and he was off to the races for an 86 yard INT TD.  #1 play on ESPN's Top Ten of the night.  The crowd went absolutely insane.

And then the defense showed up.  Indiana took the ball down to the Iowa 3 yard line.  1st down, a run.  Stuffed.  2nd down, pass.  Batted down.  3rd down, Indiana throws a fade to the far end zone.  Catch, ruled a TD, overturned (questionably, but I'll take it).  Indiana goes for a field goal... missed.  No points.  more insane crowd.

Oh look... we're not done throwing INTs.  I think Stanzi was confused... he thought the Iowa players dressed up in white for Halloween.  2 more INTs thrown, making 4 total in the 3rd quarter.  Indiana gets a grand total of 3 points out of those.  That had to be frustrating.  Crowd is extremely pissed during all of this, because we're having great opportunities and not doing anything about it.

And then we get to the 4th quarter... Down 24-14.  Iowa decides to go for style points (and the victory, of course).  1 play, 92 yard TD from Stanzi to McNutt.  Indiana has a 3 and out.  Next play, Stanzi to DJK for a 66 yard TD.  Next posession, Iowa gets an INT.  Wegher, the other true freshman running back on the Iowa squad, ends off getting a 6 yard TD run.  Another 3 and out for Indiana.  Iowa goes to run out the clock, and ends off punching in a 27 yard run.  2 plays and another INT for Indiana.

The amazing stats of the game?  4 INTs for Stanzi and Iowa in the 3rd quarter... 3 points for Indiana.  11 plays in the 4th quarter for Indiana... 2 INTs, 4 TDs given up to the Hawks in that time.  Stanzi in the 3rd: 4-11, 48 yards, 4 INTs.  Stanzi in the 4th: 3-3, 177 yards, 2 TDs.

Honestly, I'm still in a small bit of shock over the game.  I can't really wrap my mind around what happened, or how it happened.  I'm waiting for this game to be replayed on ESPN Classic so I can watch it from the comfort of my home.  You can't script a game like this... it's like a bad horror film that the good guys finally rise up and kick the crap out of the bad guy.  Ironic that a game like this lands on Halloween.

My best football moment was obviously when Cris Carter made his 1,000th career catch for a TD 15 rows in front of me in the Metrodome.  My best football game in attendance?  This one, by far.  What a Thriller...

Other notes from the day in sports:

\- Tennessee's black uniforms look outstanding.  So do Georgia's black helmets. - I called Oregon upsetting USC.  I didn't call Oregon blowing out USC.  Yeesh. 47-20?  Owie. - I predict right now that Texas takes over the #2 spot in the polls, with idle Alabama slipping to 3 and Iowa slipping to #5.  Oregon should vault over Iowa, TCU, Boise St. Cincy, and LSU and claim the #4 spot. - If TCU, Boise St., Houston, or any other team have a desire to win a national championship, then they need to start scheduling some real football games.  Play Notre Dame.  Play a high level Big Ten team.  Play a mid-high level Big East/Big 12 team. - I'm more excited to watch 20-and-under ranked teams play "bubble" teams than I am watching LSU play Tulane (insert other equally-good and equally-not-good teams at your discretion).  The Oregon/USC game was only good because it was an upset.  The Texas/Oklahoma State game was just dumb.  Conversely, Auburn beat #25 Ole Miss 33-20, and Tennessee beat #22 SoCar 31-13.  #19 Miami held on against Wake Forest 28-27. - Case Keenum should win the Heisman trophy.  Screw the fact he plays for Houston.  44-54, 559 yds, 5 TDs is just insane.  And he's been doing this all year.  And the team's ranked #18 currently.  Deal with it, voters.
