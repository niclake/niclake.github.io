A current wish list, for those that give a hoot about things like this.

- A new computer (27" quad-core iMac... <drool>)
- Various PS3 games (Uncharted 2, Tekken 6, God of War 3/God of War Collection, Assassin's Creed 2, Final Fantasy XIII/XIV, MAG, Bioshock 2, Gran Turismo 5)
- An Xbox 360 for various games (Forza 3, Halo 3/ODST/Reach, etc. etc.)
- A bean-bag chair (though I currently have no place to put this)
- Fender American Vintage '52 Telecaster
- A new guitar amp (Vox AC15CC1)
- Guitar effects
    - Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi
    - Dunlop 95Q Crybaby Wah
    - Ibanez TS9DX Tube Screamer
    - BOSS BD-2 Blues Driver/ZVex Vexter Box of Rock/Visual Sound V2JH Jekyll & Hyde (probably 2 of those)
    - BBE Sonic Stomp
    - MXR Phase 90
    - Digitech Whammy
    - TC Electronic NR-1 Nova Reverb
- A new board to fit everything (more than likely custom-built... apparently IKEA has some shelving units that can make great pedal boards)
