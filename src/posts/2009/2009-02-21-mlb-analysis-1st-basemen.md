I'm a huge baseball fan.

I take that back; I'm a huge baseball freak in hiding.

I \*love\* baseball. I hate math, but for whatever reason, the game that is so focused and keyed on numbers and statistics is held very near and dear to my heart. I celebrated Red Sox Truck Day (for those that don't know, Truck Day is the day that a certain team's equipment trucks leave from their home clubhouses to move all their equipment to their spring training facilities). If this doesn't classify me as a "baseball freak", I guess I don't really know what does.  So, with this being my first season doing fantasy baseball, I thought that I would do my own personal in-depth analysis of all the players at all positions... my own personal "Top 10" lists.

DISCLAIMER: Before I begin, I want to state this very clearly: This is not purely a fantasy baseball ranking sheet.  Rather, this list is more of they hypothetical "Pick your sandlot team" sort of thing; things like defense, clubhouse presence, and intangibles are all going to be slight factors in my list.  However, I will also key in last seasons (and a few past seasons) Fantasy Baseball Formula score along with my rankings (labeled FS).  Here is the formula that I'm going to use in this case:

Hitters: (Runs x 5) + (Hits x 4) + (HR x 15) + (RBI x 5) + (SB x 15) - AB

Pitchers: (W x 30) + (SV x 25) + (IP x 5) + (SO x 4) - (H x 3) - (ER x 4) - (BB x 3)

This is actually taken straight from how ESPN scores their fantasy baseball, so I feel this will accurately represent each player well in the fantasy setting.

And so, with no further ado... Ladies and gents, my rankings of the MLB 1st basemen.

In my mind, first basemen in the MLB are known for a few key things: quick reflexes, great range, a trusty glove, and a heavy bat.  First basemen are known for their ability to hit for power.  It's fairly commonplace for some American League DHs to get playing time at first base during interleague play (or if they're ever traded over to the National League).  Of some names that I can think of off-hand... Delgado, Dunn, Fielder, Howard, D.Lee, Pujols, Teixeira... that's a lot of heavy-hitting, highly-touted athletes right there.  This is definitely going to be a tough list to work through.

**10. [Carlos Peña](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=150289) (Tampa Bay Rays) Fantasy Scores (FS) - 2008:** 1364 - **2007:** 1867 - **2006:** 48

Peña manages to break in to the top 10 list largely based off of his team's success last season. It's always refreshing to see teams filled with relatively unknown players make a huge dent in the plans of the perennial powerhouses (that's what makes sports so exciting). A career journeyman, Peña has played for 5 organizations in his 9 year career (6, if you count the Rays and their name change). His stats take a bit of a dip in '06 due to only playing 18 games for the Red Sox (one of those in the outfield), but overall he's a very solid player. A career .251 hitter, with a .496 SLG%, he is also an outstanding defensive player, with his fielding average dipping below 99% only twice (the lowest being 98.7% in his '01 rookie season). At age 31, he's just now going through his prime, and I expect to see another solid season out of him this year.

**9. [Carlos Delgado](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=113232) (New York Mets) FS - 2008:** 1690 - **2007:** 1228 -**2006:** 1542

An aging player (36) on an annual choking team, Delgado and the Mets have a lot to prove this season. While pitching has been their downfall in the past few seasons, the Mets will be nothing without production from their hitters. Delgado hit 38 home runs and knocked in 115 runners last season. The question is, can he do better and get his team over the edge?

**8. [Justin Morneau](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=408047) (Minnesota Twins) FSs - 2008:** 1600 - **2007:** 1505 -**2006:** 1858

Morneau is a stud. Nothing more really needs to be said about this. Last year, his power hitting production dropped off (only 23 HRs, as opposed to 31/34 the previous two season), but his average was higher (flat .300), and he had more RBIs and runs scored. With a relatively young team in the Twins and a large amount of talent all around the diamond, Morneau is small but extremely key part of Minnesota's future. I expect another season similar to his '06 campaign, where he hit .321 with 34 HRs and 130 RBIs.

**7. [Prince Fielder](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=425902) (Milwaukee Brewers) FS - 2008:** 1555 - **2007:** 2007 -**2006:** 1387

Prince Fielder is the youngest player to grace this top 10 list (at age 24), but shows that he is definitely here to stay. 2007 was his breakout season, crushing 50 HRs and knocking in 119 RBI. My only concern about Fielder is his ability to hit for average. He seems to swing for the fence ever single time he steps to the plate, but sometimes you just need to put the ball into play and let your teammates do some work behind you. I'd like to see him get across the plate a little more (he had 109 during his '07 season, but under 90 in '08 and '06), but 160 hits a season is definitely nothing to sneeze at. Watch for Fielder to mature as he gets older and become a more well-rounded player.

**6. [Mark Teixeira](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=407893) (New York Yankees) FS - 2008:** 1774 - **2007:** 1535 -**2006:** 1650

There is no doubt that Teixeira is a quality baseball player, but is he worth the $180 million that the Yanks signed him for? I personally don't think so. There are many better ways the Yankees could've spent that money to shore up multiple positions. 30 HRs and 110 RBIs seem to be the MO of Tex, but I'm predicting that the pressure of New York and the AL East is going to wear him down this year, as the Yankees miss the playoffs again this season.

**5. [Kevin Youkilis](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=425903) (Boston Red Sox) FS - 2008:** 1644 - **2007:** 1220 -**2006:** 1197

As I stated earlier, this isn't a post solely based on numbers. Youk's batting average was 4 points higher than Tex's, but all his other stats are just a bit lower. On the other hand, he is a fiery leader in the infield, a solid defensive presence, and he seems to be heading towards the peak of his career as we speak. His RBI production jumped by 32 this past season, and I'm hoping to see that continue. A few more hits and home runs, and we will be talking about Youkilis as the template for a solid first baseman in the MLB.

**4. [Miguel Cabrera](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=408234) (Detroit Tigers) FS - 2008:** 1734 - **2007:** 1754 -**2006:** 1859

A very statistically sound player, Cabrera seems to have found a home in Detroit. While his runs, hits, and RBI have all decreased slightly over the past 3 seasons, he has managed to increase his HRs and RBI production in that span. Another young player (only 25 years old), Cabrera shows some real promise. The key will be if the Tigers can produce around him as a whole. If they can, watch Cabrera and Detroit make a legitimate run at the playoffs.

**3. [Lance Berkman](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=204020) (Houston Astros) FS - 2008:** 1943 - **2007:** 1663 -**2006:** 2015

No joke, this pick surprised me a bit. I didn't even think Lance would make my list, much less break in at #3. While only hitting 29 HRs and 106 RBIs, he highlighted last season with 18 steals, 114 runs scored (2nd most of all 1st basemen I analyzed), and a very respectable .312 avg. His only downfall at this point are his age (33); I don't think he'll be hitting his 40 HRs a year anymore, but if he can stay healthy and keep his production in the gym up, I expect another outstanding statistical season from Berkman.

**2. [Albert Pujols](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=405395) (St. Louis Cardinals) FS - 2008:** 1964 - **2007:** 1695 -**2006:** 2293

I don't think Pujols can ever repeat his 2006 performance (49 HRs, 137 RBIs, .331 avg), but this is another case where I see age translating into a well-rounded player; his average is actually up (to .357 last season), he has more hits (187, up 10 from his '06 season in 11 fewer games), and his power numbers are still All-Star caliber. A tossup for my #1 slot, I'd still take Albert in a heartbeat.

**1. [Ryan Howard](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=429667) (Philadelphia Phillies) FS - 2008:** 1992 - **2007:** 1909 -**2006:** 2282

The only first baseman to \*average\* a fantasy score of over 2000 (2061), Howard continues to crush the opposition with his heavy hands and bat. In the last 3 seasons, he has averaged 51 HRs, 144 RBI, and 159 hits. However, his average has steadily gone down ('06 - .313 '07 - .268 '08 - .251), but at age 29, I don't foresee this as a huge problem for Howard and the Phillies. Look for him to have another outstanding performance this season.

**Honorable Mentions - Derek Lee (Chicago Cubs), David Ortiz (Boston Red Sox)**

Both of these players are stout, high-caliber players in the majors, but unfortunately I couldn't justify them making this top 10 list.

Ortiz, primarily a DH, had some extremely productive years in '06 and '07 (FS 2167 and 1914, respectively), but had a very off year due to a wrist injury. I question how productive he's going to be this season, in part due to the injury, as well as being without Manny Ramierz as his sidekick in the lineup.

Lee, while being a great player and knocking in about 20 home runs every season, suffers from being just too average. His fantasy scores the past 3 seasons were 1436, 1438, and 565 (he only had 175 ABs in the '06 season), whereas even #10 on my list (Peña) turned in a score of 1867 in the '07 season, as well as cranking out 77 homers the last 2 seasons. However, he does hover around .300 Avg, so I feel this is more of a matter of his teammates around him dragging him down a bit.

If you fantasy owners out there have a bench slot left, these guys may be good pickups, as both are noted for being very streaky.

So my initial goal of cranking one of these out every day might not necessarily be feasible... I didn't realize exactly how much work was going to go into these posts. Rest assured, I'll have these out in plenty of time for you fantasy owners out there.
