By the way, I never really posted on this before... so here it is.

Go to about the 1:00 mark if you want to see just the steal.

Really, when someone is on 3rd base, and you're a lefty... why in God's name are you pitching from the windup?

Let me rephrase that... when someone is on 3rd, and they already have a ton of steals that early in the season, and you're a lefty with a slow delivery... why in God's name are you pitching from the windup?

It's not like this is the first time this has happened before, nor is it the first time it's happened to Andy Pettite.  ESPN First Take had Aaron Hill on this morning, and they revisited his steal in the 2007 season... against Andy Pettite.

2:15 mark on that video.

And that one was out of the stretch.  Pettite never even looked over to see the lead that was being taken on him.

I think \*I\* could steal home on Andy Pettite.  I just ran this morning for the first time in a couple of months, and I'm sitting here still out of breath.

This is a guy that's made $113m+ over his career with the Yankees and Astros.  He's been around the block, he's won 20+ games twice, and he knows what it takes to be an All-Star caliber pitcher.  Yet he can't seem to hold a guy on 3rd base if his life the game depended on it.  (I know, I know, these are 2 extreme examples... but he still let it happen.  Not smart.)

Maybe steroid use lowers situational awareness...
