Tonight was why I love fantasy football.  Probably the most intense thing that I can participate in with this disgusting cough.

Going into tonights game, I was trailing by 5 points.  Our league is a little bit crazy, giving out massive amounts of points for all kinds of things.  Needless to say, when I saw that I had the Saints defense and my opponent had Roddy White remaining, I felt extremely confident that I could pull off the victory.

Then Roddy White went off.  Absolutely crazy game for him.  4 receptions (4 points) for 108 yards (10 points) and a TD (6 points).  At one point, he had a 7 yard TD reception (which would've given him an extra 8 points) called back by review.  Every Atlanta possession, I'm alternating back and forth between elation and frustration.  White just seemed to have our number.  Saints couldn't seem to return any kicks at all (only 89 return yards tonight).  But 3 sacks and 2 INTs (including a pick-6) helped me stay close.  (Oh, and to make matters worse for the whole game... I was rooting for the Saints to win, since I chose them this week in Pick'em.)

And then the final sequence of plays/possessions occurred.

I'll have to set this up a bit.  I'm trailing 150-148.  Atlanta has the ball, and they're driving.  I'm crossing my fingers that White doesn't touch the ball, hoping that the Saints can pull something off.  At one point, the Saints sack Ryan (+2) and he fumbles the football, and a linebacker recovers the football (+2).  4 point play, and I'm in the lead!  But no, it was just an incomplete pass... (-4).  Rawr!

So as the drive progresses, the Saints end off getting a sack on 3rd down (+2), forcing the Falcons to kick a field goal.  I'm tied now, so this is better than nothing, right?  Wrong... by kicking that field goal, the Falcons scored 27 points on the day, moving them into a different points bracket, and giving me -1 point.  Suddenly I'm trailing 150-149, and the Saints are going to recover the onside kick.  19% chance for kicking teams to recover... this is so over.

Nope!  Falcons recover an onside kick and start driving down the field.  My whole "don't throw to White" chant comes out in full force again, and I get my wish.  At one point, White got his hands on it, but it was an incomplete pass.  Then, with 11 seconds to go, Matt Ryan chucked the ball down the field in a hail mary pass, which probably has an even less chance of succeeding than an onside kick, and the ball is picked off for a 3rd time by the Saints defense.  +2 points for Nic and the Skol Crushers (yes, I'm a Vikings fan... get off me), and a 1 point victory, 151-150.

Seriously, people... play fantasy football.  You'll be so involved in the game, even if you're only cheering for one particular player/defense.
