I realize this is slightly old (I posted this on my [personal blog](http://themusicplaysyou.wordpress.com) on Aug. 1 of last year), but I still find it hilarious.

T’was the night before August and all through the Nation the fans on their feet in a standing ovation Ramirez — the baby — is off to L.A. So who is this guy they call Jason Bay?

He bats from the right and throws that way too And produces the home runs; he has 22 Will he ever be Manny? “Not a chance” might be true But when he hits his first homah, we’ll all say “Manny who?”

He’ll protect our Big Papi and with Mike at his back He’ll make up for what with Ramirez we lack: Good defense in left field, base-running skill too And he’ll run out the grounders unlike you-know-who

If you look at the stats, Bay’s a star on the rise While Manny – his stature – is shrinking in size Just look at the stats. Can you guess who is who? AVG. HR RBI OBP SLG Player 1: .282 22 64 .375 .519 Player 2: .299 20 68 .398 .529 (I’ll give you a hint: Good-Bye Player 2!)

With the A’s due in town, get the offense on track! But will Papi and Bay will be a formidable attack? At the end of the day brings an unnerving truth: Yes, Papi and Manny were like Gehrig/Ruth

So here’s some advice from a local Sox fan Please try to get it right if you can: Say “Wall”; not “Green Monster” Pronounce “Pahk” with no “R” Produce like you’ve been doing and you’ll be a star.

The “bleachers” are in right field Pesky’s Pole’s “down the line” Say “I hate the Yankees” and you’ll fit in just fine.

By the way Red Sox Nation, raise your glass in a toast Pay homage to an old friend who’s on the West Coast He’s a friend of the Nation and a really good sport: Thank you, thank you, oh thank you dear old friend Frank McCourt

So we hope for the best as the day turns to night I’ll just finish my poem and turn out the light But as I try to sleep, I turn and I toss Jason Bay for Ramirez, Hansen, and Moss?

Did we make the right choice? Did we give up too much? Will Jason Bay ever hit in the clutch? I find I can’t sleep and I sit up in fright I know Manny was wrong; God I hope Theo’s right.

But what about Manny? How hard will he play Now playing with Nomar and Lowe in L.A? I promise you this, there’s more to his story As you head off to bed, say a prayer for Joe Torre!
