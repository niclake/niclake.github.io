First off... I'm not biased.  If I was, I'd vote for Shaq.  So don't throw that weak tot action my way.

Alright, so... first off, I think we need to look at the definition of MVP.  Here's what thefreedictionary.com has to say:

> **Noun 1. MPV** - the player judged to be the most important to the sport

Ok, understandable... I guess I could see that, but that's not good enough for me.  What about dictionary.babylon.com?

> **Definition of MVP - player on a sports team who made the largest contribution toward a win; award given to the team player who made the most important contribution toward a win** 

**This is much more to my liking: "team player who made the most important contribution toward a win".  I think it encompasses the what the MVP is all about.**

**If \*I\* had to write a definition, it would be something along these lines...**

> **MVP** - The player who, by being absent from their team, would cause them to wallow in crapiness and self-pity; the player who puts his/her team on his/her back and says "let's go".

Much more specific, I think.

Now, the current talk in the game is Kobe vs. LeBron.  Two high-octane, high-scoring players, each leading their team to (current) division leads, current 5 game winning streaks, and highlights galore.  The only other person that I might consider at this point as an MVP candidate would be Rajon Rondo (yeah, I know, I slurp him a little bit), but with so much star talent on that team, we really don't know what would happen if he just happened to disappear for a while.  (Rondo, you want the MVP?  Get hurt for 2 weeks and we'll see if the Celtics suffer.)

Now, let's look at stats.

- Player 1: 36.6 minutes, 27.6 ppg, 5.0 assists/game, 5.5 reb/game, 87.1% FT, 35.5% 3-point
- Player 2: 37.5 minutes, 28.7 ppg, 7.1 assists/game, 7.4 reb/game, 77.3% FT, 31.3% 3-point

Give up?  1 is Kobe, 2 is LeBron.

Really, comparing the two of these guys is like comparing a military sniper and a dude with a shotgun.  Kobe is all about finesse, working within the triangle to slash in from the perimeter unopposed, post up a guard, or nail the wide open jumper.  He is truly the Jordan of this generation, creating magic with the basketball night after night.

LeBron, on the other hand, is all about the power.  At 6'8" and "250 plus", James is an absolute monster that can handle the ball, shoot jumpers (sometimes...) and deliver absolute thunderous dunks... that is, when he's not sitting on the opponent's hoop, waiting to block a lazy shot from someone driving through the lane.

But again, let's review my definition of MVP:

> MVP - The player who, by being absent from their team, would cause them to wallow in crapiness and self-pity; the player who puts his/her team on his/her back and says "let's go".

Kobe has a lot of help on his team... Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum (he's hurt, but he's part of the team), Lamar Odom, Derek Fisher, and Jordan Farmar.  (By the way, I find it kind of sad that after Kobe, the next best assist/game is Pau with 3.7.  I realize they're in the triangle offense, but still...)  LeBron on the other hand... Mo Williams (a definite all star in his own right), Big Z, Delonte West, Varejao, Szczerbiak, and Big Ben Wallace.

You could build a team around Pau if you really wanted to.  LeBron has a bunch of role players who (I can only assume) are told to give him the ball in the clutch, and get the you-know-what out of the way.

Kobe has had off nights... he had one just the other night, in fact.  Terrible first half against the Thunder (yes, I know... the Thunder.  But he did only have 10 points).  The Lakers struggled, ground their teeth, and stood their ground against the Soni... er, Thunder without Kobe's help, and then allowed him to lock it up late in the 4th, finishing with high 30-some points.

I don't think LeBron James or the Cavs know that it's possible for "off night" and "win" to exist in the same sentence.

The Cleveland Cavaliers are going to make the NBA Playoffs, and make a good solid push against all the other contenders (Boston, Orlando, Atlanta, and the rest) right up until the Eastern Conference Finals.  At that point, LeBron's back is going to buckle under the combined 3,167 lbs of his team (yes, I calculated it, but we all know that every pro athlete lies about their weight... I mean, who doesn't?) as they fall to the mighty Celtics (Rajon!  You didn't get hurt?  Sorry, man... I tried to get you back into this conversation...).  But every night during the regular season, it is basically LeBron James (with cameos by guys dressed similar to him) against whoever the opponents decide to throw at him on a given night.  KG?  Get out of my way.  Shaq?  I'll go around you.  KG \*and\* Shaq?  Who the heck pulled that trade off?

James constantly picks up the star player on the other team on the defensive end.  He shows up on both ends of the floor.  He \*is\* the face of the NBA right now, with more charisma in his 24-year-old body than Barack Obama will display in his entire 4 (8?) year tenure as President of the United States.

LeBron James, alongside Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, and select others, are the new guard here in the NBA, and wielding that crown and scepter is a job that can only be fulfilled by a King.  That is why my (theoretical) 2009 vote for the NBA's MVP goes to LeBron James.

By the way... hey Mike Brown... how much do you weigh?
