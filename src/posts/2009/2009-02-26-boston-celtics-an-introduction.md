Hello,

I'm the Boston Celtics.  I'm the most successful franchise in the history of the NBA, with 17 championships under my belt.  Heck, I even won 8 straight!  You can't beat that.

Over the years, I've been host to some of the greatest rivalries in all of sports, competing against the Lakers, Sixers, and Pistons tooth and nail every season.  It's great to see that Kobe has maintained the Lakers prominence, by the way... Allen Iverson is in the process of killing both of the others (well, the Sixers are just now getting off of life support, so he may need to give it another g0).  I mean, how often do you get serious rivalries that span the entire length of a country?

I've also been home to some of the absolute greats in the NBA; Cousy, Havlicek, McHale... heck, even Marivich, Wilkins, and Walton played here for a while.  Oh, and there are those guys Larry Bird and Bill Russell as well... can't forget them.  Or what about the coaches?  The great Arnold "Red" Auerbach was one of the greatest coaches of all time, spending 17 seasons as coach and over 50 as a member of the organization.  (Oh, and there was that Bill Russell guy too...)

And look at us now.  We're one of the greatest teams in the NBA right now.  (I know, the Cleveland LeBrons have the lead right now... but that's ok.)  The Boston Three Party arrived in force last year with Pierce (who has graciously stuck with us for years and years, just waiting for this moment), Allen, and Garnett, and we managed to snag one of the greatest point guards in the game that no one knew about (to be completely honest, we were all surprised when Rondo showed his moxie... I'm guessing that we will need to dig into our checkbook soon).  Our team chemistry is unmatched (well, at least outwardly... we really do have some spats, but we keep them "in the family"), our defense is superb, and we are poised to make another run to the NBA Finals and our 18th championship.

I hate to take away from the star power of this autobiography, but I do need to bring up another name... Stephon Marbury.  I don't know who the fool was that started the rumor that we \*wanted\* Stephon.  Maybe before the '07-'08 season, we might have considered it.  Now, though?  Not a chance.  You see, I need to tell you something about our team, and about our wonderful coach Doc Rivers.  Doc does not get nearly enough credit for his job.  Managing the egos of 3 superb, stellar athletes is no small feat.  Very few people could ever pull that off, and Doc has done it with very few hitches.  But we already have a potentially volatile mix, and you're telling me you want to add Allen Iv... wait, no, that was earlier.  You want to add Marbury to our team?  I'm sorry, I didn't realize that in amidst all the championships that we'd won, the NBA had created a "ball-hog" position (you hear that, Kobe?).  You see, Marbury is this thing I like to call a "cancer" to a team.  Dude's got an absolutely terrible attitude... honestly, I would too, if I was traded for Jason Kidd and Steve Nash, and they just so happened to do amazing right after I leave.

So to you, mysterious sports writer... and to you, ESPN, for prolonging this absurdity... stop it.  Just stop.  We want Marbury about as much as the Yankees want Barry Bonds.  Both moves are born out of sheer desperation, and to be honest, desperate is about the last term that I can think of for us, the Boston Celtics.  If you'd like to point a good 3-point shooter to come off the bench for us our way, by all means, we'd love that.  But it's gotta be a role player, not a straight-up player.

Sincerely, Your Boston Celtics

(Wait, what? The Yankees are in talks with Bonds? Seriously? Man, and I thought that was a great analogy there. Well, wait... I guess they are pretty desperate lately...)
