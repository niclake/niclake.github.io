I'm coming to discover that you really get to know who a person is when you hang out with them while they are intoxicated.

Also... I'm done being the "nice guy" for everyone.  If you deserve it, great, but if you don't, my patience is on thin ice thanks to the abuse of a select few (who shall remain nameless).

The Yankees are now playing .200 ball against the Sox this season.  Tonight was frustrating... 0-0 into the 15th inning.  I was scared the entire time, just waiting for Pap to explode or one of our other relievers to throw a poor pitch.  And of course, A-Rod was the one to hit the home run to win it.  Wonderful.

I usually [don't like Bill Simmons](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/simmons/index) and [his tweets](http://www.twitter.com/sportsguy33), but he is a Red Sox fan, and some of the stuff he comes up with is pretty creative and often hilarious, if somewhat vulgar.  For example, some tweets from tonight...

\- "'Nobody's hit a Bard fastball yet. I'm gonna keep calling for breaking balls.' --Jason Varitek" - "Nice work by Bard! Clay Buchholz would have left a puddle of pee on the pitching rubber had that been him. This is officially a must-win." - "Yankee fans chanting "steroids" while Papi is up only hurts their 3rd baseman's feelings." (probably why he hit a home run later... blech) and finally... - "That game didn't just kill the 2009 Red Sox season, it chopped it up and put it in different suitcases like a serial killer."

It hurts, but sometimes you just have to laugh, even if it is at the expense of your favorite team.

School starts in 2 weeks.  I'm pumped.

Trading in video games tomorrow so I can go purchase an external hard drive.  It's about time... my Mac is practically screaming at me, begging for some virtual memory.  It'll be nice, because now I won't have to hunt through my iTunes, wondering about which songs I should delete to free up space to get more stuff.

I'm learning that I really like my hair short.  Just got it buzzed down to 1/8" today (sorry, Jessa!  I had to...), and it feels terrific.  I do get a little wigged out though, when I reach up to scratch something and end off petting my hair (or what remains of it) for a minute or so.  Makes me laugh.

So Dad had an angioplasty on Wednesday.  He was a little nervous about it (from what I hear), but apparently things went ok.  Docs found a 90% blockage in his heart that they didn't know about before, so that's a relief that they caught it and took care of the problem.  "Doctor" Mom has stipulated that he's not working for 2 weeks, and then he only goes back part time for a while.

... Yeah, I give that just a few days before they get on each others nerves. ;-)

Heat index of 100 this weekend.  Boo yah.  I honestly can't wait... it just rained, so the humidity should be down just a little bit too, meaning it's just going to be nice, hot weather.  I should probably go get my sunglasses from my old car.

Which reminds me.  The parents finally decided to acquire a new vehicle.  Long story short, my car sucked, and Mom was having problems sitting down into a low car.  So she acquired a '05 GMC Envoy, I got the '96 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and the '88 Buick Regal is going to some dumb high school kid some great person who needs a relatively inexpensive first car.  Win-win all around, in my eyes.

So... I've managed to entertain myself for a solid week with nothing to do.  Bike rides, daytime television, and lots of videogames (thus, the [Konami Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code) as my blog title).  Sadly, I've exhausted my tolerance for television, and I really don't have any fun/challenging games to play... and the Wellness Center doesn't open until the 17th... so next week is going to comprise of a lot of guitar playing.  Not a bad thing at all.

I'm really torn right now.  I know in my heart that I need a new computer.  My laptops are great and all, but I would love a real desktop.  Problem is... money.  Now, I'm not talking whether I have it or not (I don't... this is all just future speculation)... no, I'm talking in regards of how much money.  See, I really want an iMac, but loaded out the way I'd like would run me almost $2,000.  On the other hand, I could build my own PC for around/less than $1,000, and it would be comparable to the iMac in almost every way (if not better), except for one thing... the operating system.  (Before anyone suggests it, no, I don't want a Hackintosh.  If I have a Mac, I'd rather it be the real thing than something that I'd cobble together and hope that it works.)  So basically, do I want to spend extra $$ on an operating system that I've grown up with and know very well (and like a lot better), or do I want to geek out and build a machine (which would be fan-flippin'-tastic), only to install a not-so-fun OS on it?  (Yeah, I could install Linux... but I like the glitz and bling and whatnot, and Linux definitely doesn't do that as well as Macs or Windoze.)

Or do I just get a Telecaster instead?  Choices, choices.

Things that rock right now... - Bike rides - Nice weather - Some classic James Brown (Sex Machine is stuck in my head right now) - Sunrises (I witnessed my first one in a few years just this past week) - Google Voice (though I have no true application for this at this time, it's still really cool) - The fact that school is just around the corner - Not being broke

It's 0235.  It is absolutely pouring outside.  Doug is snoring on the couch next to me.  Why am I still up?  Yeesh.  I'm going to bed.
