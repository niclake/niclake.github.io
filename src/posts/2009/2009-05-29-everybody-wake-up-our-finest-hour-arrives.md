![](images/University-of-Northern-Iowa-3C24A1E2.276151000_std.jpg)I'm thrilled to go back to school.  Stoked.  Nervous, sure, but I'm ready to do this.  My only worry/thought is that I may be graduating long after all of my peers.  A lot of people that I entered college with are either done, have 1 year for a comprehensive major/minor, or just student teaching left to complete.  Me?  3 years, if I push it.

As I was working at Hy-Vee the other day, I ran into Steve McCrea, the former ALPHA instructor at Cedar Falls High School.  We were talking about life, how retirement was treating him, and things of this nature.

(As a small segway... I wasn't in ALPHA during high school.  I dropped out after 8th grade when the teacher made it clear that ALPHA was "the most important class" and required me to not be in my other classes.  I wasn't a fan.  However, in high school, and more specifically my senior year, I spent pretty much all of my free time in the ALPHA room, talking with people, pretending to do homework, or napping during my 2 release periods.  People included me in things, I felt like I belonged there, and I also assisted a couple of people on their projects... but I was never officially an ALPHA member.)

Anyway... I told him about what was going on with me going back to school, and my wishes to graduate "ahead of someone I went to high school with".  His reply?

> Eh, I wouldn't worry about that... it only took me 9.5 years to get my B.A.

Any of you that know McCrea know how smart of a man he is... hearing him tell me that relieved just about every fear/bad feeling that I had remaining about returning to college.

I also just realized that I've left this window open for about 2 hours, not published yet.  Well done, me.

The job at Hy-Vee is... enjoyable.  It's nothing earth-shattering... I get a chance to invoke elementary math skills (7 pineapples per crate?  Kinda weird.) and talk with people, as well as see a bunch of people from around Cedar Falls that I haven't seen in a while.  However, I have a feeling that working with fresh produce is what's causing my allergies to kick into overdrive lately... and since the meds I take aren't prescription, I don't always remember to take them before I go in to work.  Oops.

In other news... don't put a check on top of a pile of papers that you plan on ripping up and throwing in the garbage.  It's not conducive to putting money in your bank account.

On a very unrelated side note... [Taylor Swift is a very pretty lady.](http://www.8notes.com/images/artists/taylor_swift.jpg)

Also, I've determined that most of my blog entries deal with current life things, and titles like "Random" or "Life Stuff" only goes so far.  Thus, all blog entries, or at least the ones that don't have titles that jump out and hit me in the face with a wiffle ball bat, will be titled with whatever song I'm listening to at the time.  I'll also throw the album down at the bottom of each post.

Cedar Falls turns into quite the blah town when school isn't in session.  2 of my good friends are still around for the summer, but one works/takes a class, another has an even odder sleeping schedule than I keep, and I've worked a lot in the past couple of days, leading to not much else happening.  Also, with my roommates leaving (I still have one around here somewhere, but a bunch of his stuff is in boxes in our living room), it means my apartment will get even more boring.  Oh well... more room to put my guitar equipment (and, with no one at Hillcrest right now, the opportunity to actually play it).

When you haven't taken the lid off of a Sharpie in a few months, apparently the smell gets really concentrated inside the cap.  Not only is my head already swimming from an overload of C and Java code from this evening, but now I've huffed a little bit of that wonderful Sharpie stench.

Also... I need a new hard drive, as well as a new laptop battery.  The hard drive, because I'm scrounging for space as it is (went through and deleted non-vital system files today... yuck).  The battery, because 30 minutes without an adapter is just not going to cut it when I return to school.
