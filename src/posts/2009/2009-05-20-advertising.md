Advertising... the single greatest way to draw people to your product (or push them away).  Why have I only eaten at Jimmy Johns once?  Because their commercials are so stupid that I feel like I just lost 30 seconds of my life.  Why am I going to go out and buy a 6-pack of Rolling Rock here in the near future? ....

I swear beer companies have just about the funniest and most creative ad teams ever.
