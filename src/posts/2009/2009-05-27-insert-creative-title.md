I now understand why my dad complains about his feet hurting.  When they hurt, life sucks.

Haven't updated in a while... work has been keeping me fairly busy.  Rockin' the produce section at Hy-Vee here in Cedar Falls.  It's always a good time.

Getting slightly nervous... I go back to school in 2 weeks.  First class?  Principles of Management.  Apparently the teacher is tough, tests hard, and it's an upper-level business course.  Wonderful.

Sports aren't even a good relief for me right now.  Hockey has lost its luster for me (sometimes... I've been watching the Pittsburgh/Carolina first periods, but the Penguins have just been plowing the Hurricanes), and the NBA is just getting stupid.  For example... game 3 of the Cavs/Magic series?  86 free throws attempted.  4 technical fouls in the 4th quarter.  It's kinda nuts.  Let them play... seriously.

I miss my cousins.  I got a chance to hang out with them this past weekend, and it was a blast.  I would've participated in the tailgating of my cousin's high school graduation, but I had to work... boo.  It just felt good to be able to spend time with them... most of the time, the older cousins (or Generation eXiles) go off and go to a bar or chill or whatever... this was the first time since I turned 21 that most of the cousins were around and I was able to participate.  A bar, some music playing, and a lot of just sitting and talking.

Kinda makes me want to move to Chicago...

Also, as a side note, someone in the near vicinity of my apartment is smoking pot right now... I can smell it.
