It just struck me this morning... I'm such a passionate sports fan, I love all sports... and yet I've only been to a small sampling of professional sporting events in my life.  It's a slight oxymoron to me.  "Yeah!  Go sports!  As long as I'm sitting at my desk!"

.......... really?

I remember my first NFL game, and first pro event in general.  Nov. 30, 2000. My dad had a business trip up in Minn. to attend, and the company representative (can't for the life of me remember his name) invited us to come along to an NFL game.  Now, up to this point (I can't believe that I'm about to admit this), I wasn't really a fan of any particular NFL team, but I \*did\* have a little Green Bay Packers keychain... you remember those, with the 3 inch rubber/plastic dude dangling from his helmet?  Yeah, I had one of those.

Give me a second... I'm feeling slightly ill.

By the way... a big shout out to the company rep that took us.  My dad and I stopped at a souvenir booth, and I was like "Oooo, jerseys!"... but they were $100.  No way I was getting one of those.  So my dad grabbed me a hat instead.  And then the rep (dangit, what was his name?) came up and said "You want that jersey up there?"  I was pretty much in shock.  Such a nice guy.

Anyway, we were sitting down in the end zone, about 15ish rows up.  Part of me thinks "Man, what crappy seats".  The other part of me (I was 13 at the time) couldn't stop babbling and jumping up and down.  Here I was, at a Vikings/Lions game (pre 0-16 Lions, that is) in the Metrodome, with a new hat and a jersey that I still swim in to this day (apparently, the addition of a few pounds has made the jersey fit quite nicely).  On a Thursday, which meant I was missing school... honestly, that was probably the #2 reason for all my excitement.  Ah, childhood.

But you gotta remember... this wasn't a Tarvaris Jackson-led Vikings team... oh no.  This was Daunte Culpepper in his prime, with Randy Moss and Cris Carter as his targets.  This is the year they finished 11-5 and won the division.  Our trophy case is devoid of any Super Bowl trophies, so I drool over what I can... get off me.

Anyway, here we were in our crappy end zone seats, in my purple dress jersey and white stocking hat, cheering for absolutely no reason except I was watching a great game.  And then, suddenly, right in front of me... history happened.

Vikings were making a drive (I don't remember the quarter).  On the 4-yard line,Cris Carter split out wide to the right side.  The ball was snapped, lofted by Culpepper to the corner of the end zone, right into the waiting hands of Carter.  15ish rows in front of me.

His 1,000th career reception, and a touchdown to boot.

I remember getting a few slaps on the back from people around me as we were celebrating.  It took me until after the extra point to realize that this was because I was sporting a brand new #80 jersey... Carter's number.

Dad... help me out here.  What was that rep's name?

Going to live sporting events is magical.  I've been to 3 Vikings games (Carter 1,000th reception, the game where Randy Moss caught a pass down the middle at the end of the first half, then flipped it over his shoulder to... someone as he was getting tackled.  The guy got a TD off of it... and the Vikings/Colts game this past 2008 season, won by 5 Colts field goals and lost by TJack's terrible jump-passes) and 2 Red Sox games (no dates... but both in the Metrodome against the Twins.  The first time was in 2001 or 2002, and no one knew how to pronounce Nomar Garciaparra's last name.  The second time, we had a dad and his 5 year old son sitting behind us, and the dad thought it was hilariously funny that "Co-Co Kripsy!" was playing for the Red Sox.  Yes, Co-Co Krispy.).  I can't wait till the day that I get to see the Red Sox play in Fenway, the Cubs in Wrigley, the Bears at Soldier Field or Packers at Lambeau.  Not only is there so much history in all these parks and stadiums, but you come away from every game with some story that you'll remember forever ("Look, Tyler, it's Co-Co Krispy!"... and he'd say this about 3 or 4 times an at bat too... urgh).

So... as a sports fan... if you haven't been to a professional sporting event, go to one.  I promise that you won't regret it.
