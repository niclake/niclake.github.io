I'm sitting here in the Union with [Allyn](http://www.discobeetle.com), and we're studying for our various finals.  He showed me one of his calc tests that he took... more specifically, his answer for an extra credit question...

> Extra Credit: some random calc problem Explain The Matrix

> If you've ever seen the (second?) Matrix film where Neo gets to the Architect.  This is like that, kind of.  I, Neo, was always destined to suck at this test, and this class, until now.  You, the Architect, have seen this cycle a hundred times.  Some Neo eventually comes along, destined to be 'The One' and break the system thus achieving victory.  I will am can be the One, thus achieving the ultimate goal of a C+ or better.  But will the Architect let me turn in some late assignments?  I can defeat Smith, if only given one more chance!  Believe in Neo!

I think I pissed off some other students in the union from laughing so hard.
