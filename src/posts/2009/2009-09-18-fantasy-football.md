First of all... for your viewing pleasure... Brett Favre, ladies and gentlemen.

In my free time, I am one of the moderators of the [Vikings Yahoo group online](http://sports.groups.yahoo.com/group/vikings/).  One of the members there kindly paid for and hosted a Fantasy Football league (yeah, he paid for it... kinda insane, but I'll roll with it), and as a moderator, I was invited to participate.  Now, I've never done much in the way of fantasy sports before this calendar year.  I joined 2 fantasy baseball leagues this year, one of which I care about a little bit (currently 7th of 10 players) and one which I don't give a crap about (2nd of 10... funny how that works).  Baseball is just such a long season, it's hard to keep up with it all.

Anyway, we had our Fantasy Football draft today, and I have to admit, my team looks pretty solid overall.  When I logged on this morning, I was pretty shocked to find out I'd won the random draw for first overall pick, so that was definitely nice.  Here's the team I drafted:

QB: Kurt Warner (Ari) RBs: Adrian Peterson (Min), Marion Barber (Dal) WRs: Greg Jennings (GB), DeSean Jackson (Phi) WR/TE: Dallas Clark (TE, Ind) WR/RB: Roy Williams (WR, Dal), Willie Parker (RB, Pit) K: John Kasay (Car) DEF/ST: Tennessee Bench: David Garrard (QB, Jac), Beanie Wells (RB, Ari), Shonn Greene (RB, NYJ), Laveranues Coles (WR, Cin), Michael Jenkins (WR, Atl), Jeremy Maclin (WR, Phi)

I've pulled out 2 stud RBs, 3 solid WRs, a great TE, an excellent QB and defense, and a bench with some solid potential.  Thinking I may have to make a trade for a good #3/4 RB, since I'm not really sure how much my rookies (Beanie and Shonn) will play, and I'm worried one of my starters are going to get hurt.

Let me tell you... week 1 was a roller coaster for me.  My opponent had Santonio Holmes, who outscored my Tenn. defense in the "opening" game.  Manning didn't throw to Clark hardly at all.  Willie Parker apparently forgot how to run the football during the offseason.  Kurt Warner... well, he just plain sucked.  Without AP, I wouldn't have had any shot at winning whatsoever.

Now, a key point that you've gotta know... my first week opponent was the guy who missed the live draft, who didn't prerank his players, who has made no trades... sometimes I wonder if he remembers he signed up to do this.  The guy has Hixon and Antonio Bryant as his starting WRs... that should tell you something.

Anyway, we were neck and neck going into the Sunday Night games, and neither of us had any players on Monday.  It all came down to me having a slight lead, trotting out Greg Jennings, against his Jay Cutler and Ryan Grant.  If you watched the game, you can probably imagine how it turned out... but if you didn't, let's just say my lead had shrunk to 3 points before Jennings caught a 50-yd TD pass (1 pt catch, 1 pt for every 10 yards, 6 pts TD), and Cutler threw his 4th interception of the game.  A bit of a nail-biter.

Anyway... enough about me.  In the coming days, you should see a few more posts about the sports world... I'm back. :-D
