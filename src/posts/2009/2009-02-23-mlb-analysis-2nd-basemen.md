2nd basemen. These men are usually noted for their speed, their defense, and their speedy reaction times. However, in order to succeed in the realm of the Major Leagues, you've gotta be able to put wood to ball, knock out some clutch hits, and drive in a few runs.

I actually have a feeling that this is going to turn in to my most controversial/talked-about analysis, placing one of my rankings where I did. More on that later.

Also, my computer decided to freeze and crash on me about halfway through calculating out all these stats... so this took far longer than I thought it would.

Again, here's the formula used to calculate the Fantasy Scores (FS) for each player: (Runs x 5) + (Hits x 4) + (HR x 15) + (RBI x 5) + (SB x 15) - AB

**10. [Orlando Hudson](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=407861) (Los Angeles Dodgers) Fantasy Scores - 2008:** 744 - **2007:** 1051 -**2006:** 1215

Hudson actually had a very decent season last year, hitting .305 (his best ever) and managing to knock out 124 hits in only 107 games with the Diamondbacks. He injured himself last season against Atlanta attempting to tag out Brian McCann, so hopefully he manages to bounce back and have another solid season.

**9. [Placido Polanco](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=135784) (Detroit Tigers) FS - 2008:** 1097 - **2007:** 1313 -**2006:** 708

Polanco has definitely been productive lately, acquiring 378 hits in the last 2 seasons with Detroit. While lacking in power (he hasn't hit double digit HRs since his '03 and '04 stints with Philadelphia), he still manages to churn out RBIs, and recently has been more patient at the plate, acquiring 37 and 35 walks the past 2 years. A very solid fielder, he has turned in numerous no-error stints all over the infield, and even for 5 games in the outfield in '05, all while maintaining a career 99% fielding average.

**8. [Jose Lopez](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=430946) (Seattle Mariners) FS - 2008:** 1310 - **2007:** 799 -**2006:** 1087

With the Mariners making moves and looking to make a push in the AL West, Jose Lopez will have his hands full next season trying to reproduce his numbers from last year. 191 hits and 89 RBI are solid numbers for a 2nd basemen. However, he will need to learn to be more patient and watchful at the plate, as he has averaged 70 strikeouts over the past 3 seasons. If he can work at bringing that number down with either walks or contact, look to see Lopez make a name for himself out on the west coast.

**7. [Robinson Cano](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=429664) (New York Yankees) FS - 2008:** 1001 - **2007:** 1431 -**2006:** 1178

A career .303 hitter, Cano's average dropped to .271 last season against tough AL East pitching. All of his numbers across the board dropped; most had a negative effect on his stats (hits, runs, walks, HRs), but he did manage to decrease his strikeouts by 20 last season (from 85 to 65). At only 26, Cano still has a long career ahead of him. Let's see if he can return to his normal form in the new Yankee Stadium.

**6. [Ricky Weeks](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=430001) (Milwaukee Brewers) FS - 2008:** 1139 - **2007:** 1205 -**2006:** 981

Another young player (also 26), Weeks and the Brewers have made their presence known over the past few seasons. While I see a strong upside with Ricky, I also see two glaring negatives; his career average (.245) and his career fielding percentage (96%). If he can lower his strikeouts (over 100 the last 2 seasons) and errors (improved from his 20+ error campaigns of '05 and '06, but still in the double digits), you could see Milwaukee make a very strong push for the AL Central title.

**5. [Ian Kinsler](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=435079) (Texas Rangers) FS - 2008:** 1667 - **2007:** 1455 -**2006:** 1036

Now we're into my top 5, 2 of which surprised even me. Kinsler was one of them. I did not even think that Kinsler would be a consideration for this list, and was quite pleased to see a relatively unknown player crack into these rankings. With decent, 20 HR/season power and a pretty good eye at the plate (a .375 OBP), his numbers have done nothing but go up since he came to the majors. While I don't see Texas as a real contender in the AL, Kinsler is just one of multiple players that may be a great Fantasy pickup.

**4. [Dan Uggla](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=462564) (Florida Marlins) FS - 2008:** 1521 - **2007:** 1488 -**2006:** 1547

I think many major league teams would love to see the Marlins win another World Series. If history is anything to go by, most of their big name players would be shopped around in an attempt to lower their payroll, and Dan Uggla might top that list. A strong hitter averaging 30 HRs in his 3 seasons, his downfall is lack of patience (seems to be a common theme among these young players); 171 strikeouts and only 5 walks last season is a huge black mark on his chart. His fielding (98.2%) makes him a solid force in the middle of an infield, and he has proven (with numerous Top 10 plays on ESPN) that he has incredible range and a great arm.

**3. [Dustin Pedroia](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=456030) (Boston Red Sox) FS - 2008:** 1759 - **2007:** 1045 -**2006:** 69

Yes, the '08 MVP, the '07 ROY, and my beloved Red Sox 2nd basemen, is listed #3 on this list. Shocker. Here's my reasoning; I'm guessing quite a bit as it is on how well these players are going to perform next season, and any guesswork that I can take out of my factoring is very welcome. Pedroia has done nothing but improve in his time in the majors, cranking out 213 hits, 17 HRs, and 20 steals with only 52 strikeouts last season. However, has he reached his peak at age 25, or is he going to continue to get better?

Please, Dustin... make me eat my words (and my #3 ranking of you).

**2. [Chase Utley](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=400284) (Philadelphia Phillies) FS - 2008:** 1891 - **2007:** 1674 -**2006:** 2024

So logically, that means that Utley is going to be #1, right? Wrong. Utley is nothing short of an incredible player, hitting for power (33 HRs) and average (.292), while helping his team make annual pushes towards the playoffs in a very difficult NL East. At age 30, I think we're seeing the peak of Chase's performance, so we'll have to see how many seasons he has left in him.

So, who could be #1 then? Who could I possibly rank ahead of Uggla, Utley, and even Pedroia?

**1. [Brian Roberts](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=406878) (Baltimore Orioles) FS - 2008:** 1668 - **2007:** 1829 -**2006:** 1336

Yes, ladies and gents... Brian Roberts is my pick as the #1 2nd baseman. I did say that I'd go off of intuition as well as stats, but I think these stats speak for themselves. Check this out: Last season, Roberts had 181 hits, 107 runs, 8 triples, 82 walks, and 40 stolen bases while hitting just 4 points under .300. No, he's not a power hitter (9 HRs). Yes, he likes to swing and miss (first season with over 100 strikeouts). But on a Baltimore team that has to compete with the clout of Boston and New York every year, having a small-ball player to generate some offense can be a huge blessing. If the Orioles can manage to generate some offense around him, I look for Brian Roberts to have the best statistical season of all Major League 2nd basemen this season.

Call me crazy if you want... there you go. Up next... 3rd basemen.
