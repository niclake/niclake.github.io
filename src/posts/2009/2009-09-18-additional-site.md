So apparently, even after only being back for 1 day, I'm already being asked to write for another site.  [Most Valuable Network](http://www.mvn.com), an independent sports news site, has asked me to write for their blog [The Football Wire](http://www.mvn.com/thefootballwire).  Pretty excited.  A lot of up-and-coming, big name sports writes contribute to this site, so being included in all of that is a really awesome opportunity for me.  I'm hoping to get involved with baseball next season as well, but that's still a long ways off, so we shall see.

I've already got my [first post up](http://mvn.com/thefootballwire/2009/09/fantasy-101-early-season-dos-and-donts.html), talking about the dos and don'ts of your fantasy football draft and week-to-week management.  Go check it out, and be sure to look around the site as well.
