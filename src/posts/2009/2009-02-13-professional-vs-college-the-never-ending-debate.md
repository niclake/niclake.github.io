This is a debate that I'm sure you've probably heard before, but I thought that I would give my thoughts on it a bit.

I'll start off by saying this... When it comes to sports, I do not discriminate.  I will watch just about any sporting event that appears on my television, and I'll be super happy with it.  But what if it's a case of my Northern Iowa Panthers in a diehard Missouri Valley Conference basketball game, as opposed to an epic Boston Celtics/LA Lakers matchup?  How does one decide?  And to go further, why is college better than pro sports (or vice versa)?

I'll start with baseball.  Personally, I'm not a college baseball fan, mostly for the fact that unless it's playoff season, it's not televised.  Really hard to see teams other than your local university without the games being televised.  I'll be honest though, I did watch the College World Series the past few years, and while I'm not necessarily a fan of a 1- or 3-game series, there's just something about the younger, unknown players doing the absolute unexpected.  Take last year, for instance.  Fresno State won the NCAA Baseball title in one of the more unbelievable events in sports history.  [Check this out...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno_State_Bulldogs_baseball)

- Fresno State had never won an NCAA championship in any men's sport going into the 2008 tournament.
- The Bulldogs entered the [Western Athletic Conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Athletic_Conference "Western Athletic Conference") tournament at 33-27; they would likely not have made the NCAA tournament without winning the WAC tournament, which they did.
- They were the #4 seed in their regional. Since only four teams play in each of 16 regionals, this is the equivalent of a team seeded #13 or lower in the [NCAA basketball tournament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship "NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship"). No #4 seed had ever advanced to the College World Series. By contrast, no #13 or lower seed has ever made the "Elite 8" of the men's basketball tournament, which is arguably equivalent to the eight-team College World Series.
- Six times in the NCAA tournament, including three times in the College World Series, they faced elimination with a loss. They won all six times.
- They won a total of 10 tournament games against six different teams ranked in the top 20. ESPN pointed out that in terms of the NCAA basketball tournament, Fresno State's run would be equivalent to a 13 seed beating a 4 seed in the first round, a 5 seed in the second round, a top seed in the Sweet 16, a second seed in the Elite 8, another top seed in the Final Four, and still another 2 seed for the championship.

That is absolutely insane.  You don't often get stories like that in professional baseball.  The closest I can think of is the '04 Red Sox, being down 3-0 to the Yankees, coming back to win not only that series but the championship that season.  Fresno State doesn't get enough credit for their accomplishment simply because their sport is not well known.  A big reason for this anonymity is due to the fact that most baseball players drafted by the MLB teams don't appear on the field for a few years.  Usually, they're allocated to a minor league team and not heard from for a few years, which makes it tough to follow your favorite players throughout their careers.

What about basketball?  College basketball is the crown jewel of the new year.  With football winding down right around the time of conference play kicking in, They really only have to compete with the NBA, the NHL, and NASCAR.  When you throw in the hundreds of games a month that are played, all the interesting rivalries, the [coverage devoted to the sport by ESPN](http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/) and similar sports publications, and the fact that the high-caliber players of this sport will someday be moving on to the NBA, you garner the interest of just about every basketball fan.  Even women's basketball has an interesting story line or 2 each year (note: I'm not at all opposed to women's sports.  I know that these ladies try just as hard, if not harder, than the men in their same sport.  It's just not a personal favorite of mine), such as this year's passing of NC State's Kay Yow and Tennessee's Pat Summit reaching 1,000 wins.

Plus, there is no better postseason action than the Men's NCAA Basketball Tournament.  We're about a month away from the opening round games, but publications are already talking about "bubble teams", the emphasis of the conference tournaments, and even a few vague speculations of seeding.  NBA?  Since 16 of 30 teams make it in to the NBA playoffs (as opposed to 65 of 347 teams in NCAA Basketball), you just have to hope that your favorite team(s) are above the 50% percentile of the league.  Seems slightly boring to me.

Or what about the play itself?  I'm absolutely dazzled by players and teams in the NBA.  The things that some of these players can do, with their dribbling and shots and dunks, never cease to amaze me.  LeBron James is an absolute beast of a man, and watching him fly through the air to slam the ball home is awe-inspiring.  But you know who my favorite teams are?  Phoenix and Boston.  Phoenix, because I'm a [Shaq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal) fan, and Boston, because they play all-around basketball.  There is no "star player" on their team, but rather 3 (Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen), and a large complement of players that all have specific roles to play within the team.  They're great 3-point shooters, good on the block, and \*gasp\* they play defense.  An NBA team, focused on defense?  Unheard of.  I would be willing to bet that the Celtics would much rather hold you to 70 points than they would score 120.  College, on the other hand, stresses both sides of the ball all the time.  The good teams that everyone talks about are not one-sided teams, but have players of equal talent on both sides of the  ball.  Connecticut is talked about as a title contender because of their overall team, as well as their defensive-minded center [Hasheem Thabeet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasheem_Thabeet).  Duke and UNC are consistent contenders because of their coaches and style of play.  I could go on and on, but this post would get even longer than it already is.

Or how about football?  The only downside that I hear about college football (though not everyone agrees) is the postseason play, namely the BCS.  When you look at Div. I-AA, Div. II or Div. III college football, you see playoffs.  Div. I?  We'll let a computer pick who gets to play.  When there are 2 unanimous teams vying for a title, this is fine, and kind of a no brainer.  But what happens when there are 3, 4, 5 teams of equal skill level?  How do you let a computer pick 2 of them?  Settle all the disputes and questions on the field.  Look at Div. I-AA (a little fanboy-ism coming into play here); while App. State made a name for themselves as a powerhouse in our division, they were knocked off by a lower ranked team that would've have even been considered for the title game had a computer been picking the championship game.  And what kind of talk do you think coaches would rather have, "let's get 6 wins so we're bowl eligible!" or "let's win as many games possible so we can get a better playoff seed!"?  In a profession with such a high turnover rate of coaches, going to something like the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl (wow, what a mouthful) has absolutely no prestige, whereas taking your team to the playoffs, even just the first round, has huge implications of your team's talent and your coach's ability.  The NFL gets it right.  Playoffs are the way to go.

The same thing goes for football as it does for basketball... tons of teams, tons of rivalries, and the potential of your great players moving on to the NFL make both sports extremely popular.  In this case, though, I'm actually giving the edge to the NFL.  They have a clear-cut winner every single year, no disputes, and drama/excitement leading all the way up to the last game... plus only a week of downtime, instead of almost a month between the conference titles and the National Championship game.

Check this out... this is an interesting stat, if you're trying to debate which league is better overall.  Here's a count of the winners from all the Div. I college leagues in the past 25 years:

- NCAA Football - 16
- NCAA Basketball - 19
- NCAA Baseball - 14

What about the pro sports?

- NFL - 14
- NBA - 8
- MLB - 17

The NFL and MLB obviously have something right; the NFL has it's free agency, salary caps, and such a large amount of players coming into/going out of the league, due to the college game as well as the violence of the sport.  MLB has arbitration, plus the free agency program.  Basketball, on the other hand, suffers on a large number of fronts.  Jordan, Kobe, Bird, Wilt, Duncan... all players that have been dominating forces in the league, have/had stayed with their teams for a large portion (if not all) of their careers... teams are allowed to build complete dynasties for 3, 4, 5 years at a time, making runs deep into the playoffs year after year after year.  If you go back even more recently, other than the Celtics, Heat, and Pistons, teams have repeated back to back championships for 2 or 3 years (or, in the case of the Spurs, won 4 titles spread out over 9 years) since the Jordan era.

Obviously, it's impossible to classify \*all\* college sports as being better than the pro variants.  MLB obviously has a stranglehold over college baseball, but basketball and football are both very tight races.  I would personally pick MLB, college football, and college basketball, though it's easy for me to decide between NCAA Football and the NFL due to them being on different days (Saturdays and Sundays... I love fall semester weekends).  Sports like soccer, hockey, and the like, I have no right to comment on because I don't follow them whatsoever.

Will this prevent me from watching college baseball, the NFL, or the NBA?  Absolutely not.  But when push comes to shove... give me my Red Sox, my Duke/UNC rivalry, and my Hawkeye Football any day.
