Ladies and gentlemen... Photoshop MCE (Mind Control Edition).  Seriously.  Have you ever played with Photoshop for more than an hour?  There are times where I can picture exactly what I want to do, but I can sit for hours upon hours, do things about 20 different ways, and not get the result I want.  Rawrgityblargh.
