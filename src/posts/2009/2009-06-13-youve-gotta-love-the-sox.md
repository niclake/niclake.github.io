![](images/redsox.jpg)This is why I never, ever give up on the Red Sox, even when they under-perform at the beginning of the year... and also why I love the game of baseball so much.

- [Jon Lester](http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/1057/Jon_Lester) in his last three starts: 22.0 IP, 34 SO, 1.23 ERA, .099 BAA
- [Josh Beckett](http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/294/Josh_Beckett) since the start of May: 47.2 IP, 45 SO, 1.70 ERA, .181 BAA
- Josh Beckett in his last four starts: 28.2 IP, 30 SO, 0.31 ERA, .115 BAA
- [Dustin Pedroia](http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/173/Dustin_Pedroia) is batting .170 in 11 games since being moved to the leadoff spot in the lineup.
- [J.D. Drew](http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/176/J_D_Drew) is batting .333 with a .477 OBP in nine games since being moved to the 2-hole.
- [Kevin Youkilis](http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/175/Kevin_Youkilis) is batting .262 with a .415 OBP and four home runs in 12 games since being moved to the 3-spot.
- [Jason Bay](http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/361/Jason_Bay) is batting .255 in 12 games since being moved to the 4-hole full-time.
- **[David Ortiz](http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/291/David_Ortiz) is batting .313 in 32 at-bats in June.**
- [Jacoby Ellsbury](http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/290/Jacoby_Ellsbury) is batting .333 with a .412 OBP in eight games since being demoted from the leadoff spot.
- [Hideki Okajima](http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/301/Hideki_Okajima) has a 0.47 ERA with a .141 BAA in 18 games since April 28. He has struck out 21 in 19.2 innings in that span.

Obviously, I bolded a certain line to tell all you nay-sayers to shut your traps.

I'm slightly concerned with the combined lines of Ellsbury and Pedroia.  Dustin has always seemed to be a guy that thrives on knocking in runs, and I'm just wondering if maybe he's not seeing enough pitches before he gets up to bat or what, but .170 is kinda eh for the former MVP.  But if Jacoby is streaking like he is, why would Francona put him back into the 1 slot?

I'm really curious what would happen if we removed Pedroia's first at bat from every game, what his statistics would change to.

Lester, Beckett, and Wakefield have been absolutely destroying the opposition all season, and lately things have gotten even better.  You will win a lot of games when you hold teams under 2 runs and you have the lineup like the Sox do.  I'm really hesitant about our bullpen still, but Oki-doke has obviously returned to his form since May, so that's a relief.  My only worry is games like last night, when we don't have Pap available for the 9th inning.  Obviously, Ryan Howard is one of the best players in baseball right now, but if a walk or a hit had been given up prior to that, there would've been no chance at a 13th inning rally.

And we're 8-0 on the Yankees this season.  10 games to go, and I'd personally love to see us blank them on the entire year.  That just might be the most amazing thing I've ever witnessed over the course of an entire season for a given sport.  (Runner up: The Lions not winning a game last season.  At least Jim Rome got his kicks off of that one.)
