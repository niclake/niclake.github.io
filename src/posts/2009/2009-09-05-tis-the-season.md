... to have multiple TVs in your place of residence.

Seriously, all the games that have been on thus far have been excellent.  Watching Greg Paulis and Syracuse battle it out with Minnesota (granted, I've only seen bits and pieces) has been an excellent game.  Now they're in overtime... looking to be a good ending there.  Michigan is about ready to get rolling, seeing if they can perform as an elite team as they have in the past.  Same with Notre Dame, playing against Nevada today.

And then, of course, you have the game that we all know I really cared about today... UNI at Iowa.  UNI played an outstanding game.  To be honest, I expected the entire game to be like the 3rd quarter, with Iowa dominating nearly the entire time.  Instead, UNI came out and kicked Iowa right in the mouth, showing that we are truly a force to be reckoned with, and that we're not ranked in the top 5 in the FCS for nothing.  However, Iowa managed to prevail, giving up tons of ground to UNI on the final drive, but blocking 2 straight field goal attempts to secure a victory.

Honestly, this was the most frustrating game of football that I've ever watched.  On the one hand, I've grown up as an Iowa fan, and would like nothing better than to see them punch their way to another January bowl, Big Ten Title, and even a national championship run (maybe).  However, I'm a student at UNI, a hometown fan... I don't know.  Today was rough.  I will admit, though, that as soon as UNI put their first touchdown on the board, there was no looking back; it was UNI all the way.  And what a crazy ending to the game... it would've been a great upset, but in the long run, UNI won't be negatively affected by the loss, and I think it really helped them prove to themselves how good of a team they can be this season.

I've also managed to watch quite a bit of tennis this weekend... saw some of the men's matches last night, and I'm now sitting here watching the match between Sharapova and Oudin... a very eye-pleasing match, if you ask me, minus Oudin's purple-on-purple-on-purple attire (those shoes... wow).  Exciting to see that the young future of women's tennis (Oudin) is only turning 18 later this month... I have a feeling that Sharapova/Oudin is going to be a matchup we see many times here in the future.  Seriously, I don't know how these players hit a tennis ball like they do... I guess that's why they're the pros getting paid the good money.  Hopefully I'll be able to play and learn more before the weather gets too nasty.

Woo, sports.

![Bandwidth](images/bandwidth.png "Bandwidth")This is also the season of having shoddy internet in the dorms.  Allow me to explain... I've noticed some really poor connections over my years here at UNI, but this is the first time I've been around the dorms and had the knowledge or programs running to track this performance.  I noticed some general issues right at the beginning of the year when trying to load a YouTube video (I was getting data at 67 kb/s... sloooooooooooooooooooow), but when I contacted ResNet (the internet provider and support team on campus), they claimed that they didn't choke YouTube, nor did they know what the problem was... but they "promised to get to the bottom of it".  Hah... right.

So today, the general populace of UNI is either home for the 3 day weekend, or in Iowa City attending the UNI/Iowa game, so I figured I'd try a little test.  I got a couple different downloads running from a friend's storage space in Colorado, downloaded a few applications and codecs from the Apple site and various other locations (some apps I'll actually put into use, others were just to test this out), and loaded a YouTube video, all at the same time.  I figured maybe it was just YouTube having issues... but no, I was wrong.  67 kb/s (see image at left).  ..............?

So I loaded up [Speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net) and connected to the Minneapolis test center.  My result?  [9 Mb/s (megabits, not megabytes), which is far and away more than 67 kb/s](http://www.speedtest.net/result/557463180.png).  Ok, what gives.  Loading a web site or checking my RSS feeds can somehow surpass this mystical 67 kb/s barrier (that's where the 1.17Mb/s peak comes from).  I know that UNI has previously stated that they shape their network to dissuade people from using Peer 2 Peer networks, or just to free up the network for "everyday browsing"... but when a legit download like what I'm doing gets choked, I get a little pissed.  Never had any issues like this in all my time with Cedar Falls Utilities (just problems with dumb roommates, but that's another story).  I'm waiting to hear back from someone at ResNet about this issue, but I probably won't get a response until after the weekend is over... and I don't really expect the response to contain any results/findings either.
