To the great state of Minnesota:

1) You will never be as good as Iowa... what now?

2) I \*still\* have the unofficial state record for smallmouth bass (length, and maybe weight).  And I still regret not taking a cooler into the Boundary Waters with me.

3) You were witness to two of the greatest sporting events in history in the last two days.  No, I'm not exaggerating.

EVER](http://www.thewrap.com/article/favre-passes-cable-record-8319).  That stat alone absolutely amazes me... but then, it really shouldn't.  I went to a local bar & grill here in my city, and got there just in time to snag the last table/booth/square space of floor available.  And what a game it was.

Honestly, this was absolutely ideal for me.  Growing up, I loved sports, but didn't [have any true affiliations until I was in my early teens or thereabouts](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com/2009/05/12/culpepper-throws-up-for-carter-touchdown/).  So I kinda conformed with what everyone else did... which meant loving the Green Bay Packers.  But I didn't.  I followed them, but I only knew one player... Favre.  Even after I solidified myself as a Vikings fan, I always kept an eye on what he was doing.  Someone that good, with that much potential, you just have to know what's going on with him at all times (see: Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Drew Brees \[kinda\], or Jay Cutler \[for the added humor\]).

And so, after retiring for the 2nd time, it was to my great pleasure that #4 was now wearing purple.  Still weird to look at?  Of course.  Am I getting used to it?  Absolutely.  Loving every minute of it, and I've got high hopes for what's to come.

And so the fight vs. the Pukers was one of epic proportions.  We had defense (8 sacks by the Vikings \[[and a humorous story to go along with it](http://www.sportspickle.com/article:265/inside-the-huddle-green-bay-packers)\], strips and INTs on a few occasions).  We had offense (400yds passing by Aaron Rodgers, Favre throwing 3 TDs and NO INTERCEPTIONS!!!).  We had special teams (Chris Kluwe pinning the Packers deep on multiple occasions, one of which led to a safety, as well as Sidney Rice snagging 2 onside kicks out of the air to lock up the win).  And best of all, you had a Vikings victory.  4-0 on the season, and I can realistically see them going 12-4, maybe even 13-3 on the season.  Super Bowl bound?  Maybe.  Are we at least in for an exciting season?  Absolutely.

For those that don't know, the reason I'm a Red Sox fan is because my grandpa is a Twins fan, my first baseball game was Twins/RSox in the Metrodome, and I had to have something to rib him about a little bit.  Then I kinda fell in love with the whole mystique surrounding the Sox perpetual ability to not win a World Series.  Then they won it 3 years later.

Yeah, I was hooked.

Anyway, I do have a little bit of a soft spot for a couple of teams in sports... in baseball, beyond my RSox and the Cubs, I always enjoy watching the Braves, Cardinals, and Twins.  They always manage to put on a great show, have great managers, great teams... you get the point.  Plus, the entire concept of the last "regular season" game in the Metrodome is thrilling for just about everyone.

I'll admit, I only watched bits and pieces of the game.  Between dinner with my family, a jazz concert, and a pickup football game [in the UNI-Dome](http://www.uni.edu/infosys/tour/unidome.shtml), I got to see some of the early innings, the 8th, and the 10th to the end.  What... a... game.  If only we could make every single baseball game that exciting and action packed.  Thanks, Twins, for [ruining my 2nd round of playoff predictions already](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com/2009/09/24/2009-mlb-predictions-the-early-review-and-new-predictions/).

Relish in this, Minnesota.  It won't be the last time something as exciting as this happens in your city (I foresee a Super Bowl trophy gracing the Vikings within the next 5-10 years... hopefully sooner), but having all of this occur so quickly can easily be mind-numbing.  And deafening, from what I understand.

Is there any truth to the rumor that the 'dome was shaking both nights?
