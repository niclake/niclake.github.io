I'm not sure what's more sad... the fact that it's been nearly a week since I've written (and over a month since I've written seriously), or the fact that the one thing that gets me back is USA Soccer.

![](images/dempsey3500624.jpg)I'll be honest... I'm about as big of a fan of soccer as I am of hockey.  If it's on, I'll watch it.  If the Red Sox are playing, I'm not gonna be channel flipping... sorry.  I guess I do watch the UEFA Cup all the time when those matches are on, but international soccer?  That's a whole different ball game.  Especially when the US is involved.  Lets be honest... USA soccer isn't nearly up to par with most South American or European teams.  When this whole Confederations Cup thing started, I gave them about as much chance as I gave myself of acing my Sociology test... it could happen, but the likelyhood of it was slim to none (not because of my studying... I've been a good boy.  The professor's tests are crazy hard).

So lo and behold, USA Soccer advances out of the play-in round on an absolute miracle.  For those that don't know, here's what needed to happen for them to make the semis:

USA needed to win over Egypt by at least 3 goals. Italy needed to lose by at least 3 goals to Brazil. USA needed to score 3 more goals than Italy did.

Lo and behold... it happened.  The games going on side by side probably made this even more intense, since the US team got to go into halftime and get the updates of what was happening in the other match.  They pulled it off somehow, rejoiced for a few minutes, and then realized "oh crap, we get to play Spain".

Spain... #1 in the FIFA rankings.  35 game unbeaten streak.  15 game win streak.  Something like 451 minutes that they hadn't given up a goal.  USA was 0-3-0 lifetime against them.  And what happens?

Well, I'll tell you.  USA came out strong, putting pressure on the Spaniards, and ended off getting a goal right at the beginning of the 27th minute.  They started reeling a bit towards the end of the 1st, and were literally dominated by Spain for the entire 2nd half, but Dempsey managed to get extremely lucky (see picture above) and make the game 2-0, giving the US just a little bit of breathing room.  Bradley got a red card with 4 minutes to go in the 2nd (and let me tell you... that was one of the stupidest red cards I've ever witnessed... I could \*maybe\* understand a yellow... maybe.  But a straight red?  I think the ref was trying to get Spain back in the match), and the US defense was forced to crowd the box for pretty much the final 40 minutes.  In the end, though, Tim Howard made some absolute incredible saves and decisions, and the USA Soccer team came out victorious.

Incredible.

We now will go on to face the winner of tomorrow's South Africa/Brazil match at 1 CST on Sunday.  Somehow, that match gets shoved to ESPN2, but I guess that's ok (I'm assuming baseball will be on... I mean, really, we have to have our priorities).

In unrelated news, Manny Ramirez is back playing some minor league baseball for the Albequerqe Isotopes after his 50 game suspension for using WOMEN'S FERTILITY DRUGS.  So far, he's gone hitless with a couple of strikeouts.  In his defense, it is that time of the month...
