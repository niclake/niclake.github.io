It's really interesting how the final week of summer can be the best one of them all.

I've been stuck relatively by myself here in Cedar Falls for the summer, with only a small number of friends hanging around (and mostly working), so having Kyle, Curt and Shawn return to Cedar Falls was quite nice.  Got in a workout with Curt, 9 holes of golf with Shawn (who's game has improved dramatically... I need to pick it up.), played some tennis for the first time since high school, a round of disc golf, a fire at Jordan's, and lots of various video games.

I realize as I sit here writing this... I am in no way ready to leave college, but I'm really bummed that I'm going to be left pretty much by myself within a few years.  My close college friends all graduate somewhere between a semester and 2 years from now, and I have at least 3 left.  Time to really enjoy the remaining time, I guess.

I have a great idea for Christmas cards (yes, I'm aware it's only August).  I've acquired numerous flash drives over the years of working in the IT field at Deere or UNI, and I figure I could write a letter, get a couple of songs, maybe some pictures or whatever, and put them all on the drives and mail them out to people.  Sort of creative, right?

Tomorrow starts the new semester... Macro Economics, Personal Wellness, and Intro to Info Systems, plus my new job orientation after classes.  Probably throw a workout and maybe a little tennis in there as well.  Sometime this week, I hope to get some people together and go see District 9, Inglorious Bastards, or both.  I've heard that both movies are phenomenal, and I'm really looking forward to them.

(By the way... the post title is a song by The Killers.  It's a song that's featured in the video game Rock Band, which I've played recently with Shawn, and was also what I was listening to when I started writing... just as an FYI.)

I'm really not sure what's going to happen with me and sports here in the near future.  I'm sitting here watching the Red Sox lose to the Yankees (my rally cap has hurt since I washed my hat, but it's on nonetheless), but I've got to get life back on track in terms of school this semester.  Plus, Sun/Mon nights (which are normally reserved for football) are going to be taken up by work.  At least I'll get to catch a few Sunday day games, and I'm sure I'll take off Monday nights that the Vikings play... but baseball throughout the week, excessive amounts of Saturday college football, basketball, all that is going to have to be cut way down this year.  I'm planning to be in the front row at all 6 of the UNI football games with Shawn and Curt this year... I'm just going to have to learn to manage time really well and make it all work.

I can do this... I can do this...

Side note: tooooooooooooooons of cute females all over campus.  Hopefully I'll meet one in the near future (ha!).

Alright... day before classes begin.  That's prime goal-making time... so here goes.

1) Drop 5 lbs by Christmas. 2) Get into overall better shape... this is a prolonged goal, and one I think I'll be able to accomplish pretty easily. 3) Should really be #1... get good grades.  Most important thing right now. 4) There's a couple things that I'm working on with guitar right now... getting a few of those knocked out here in the near future would be super. 5) Goes along with #2... stay healthy.  I've been doing really really good, with no serious issues since my bout of depression was battled and conquered.  I just want to maintain good health, eat right, drink water, and all that jazz.

This is probably the first time in a long while that I've not been actually worried about money.  Sure, I'm still in the hole a little bit with some payments, but I have everything under control, and I just paid off one of the two Veridian loans that I had.

I don't think I've ever fully expressed to my parents how thankful I am for the things that they've done for me... from raising me well to giving me various things, to my musical abilities and training, to helping me out these past few years with school and finances, to giving me their old car to replace my clunker kinda-clunker... I know I don't say "thank you" enough to them, but I hope they know how much I appreciate what they do for me.  (Awwwwww....)

For the record... Larry Vanover, the umpire for tonight's Red Sox/Yankees game, has a strike zone as wide as an elephant when the Red Sox are up to bat.  This night has just been stupid with the amount of called 3rd strikes that are an easy 3-4 inches off the plate.

Enough.  Time to go to bed, and get ready for this new semester.  Good luck to everyone else going back to school as well.
