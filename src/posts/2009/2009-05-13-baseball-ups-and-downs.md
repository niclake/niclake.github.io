Ups: The state of the games being played in baseball.  Offense.  Defense.  Special teams baserunning and heads up play.  Someone has stolen home plate 4 times this season.  I haven't seen too many sacrifice bunts or bunts for hits, but those will start showing up more towards the end of the season.

It's great when Baseball Tonight chooses to show a top 10 for Web Gems, instead of just top 5.  And they were all great ones, too. Even teams that aren't in early contention (the Pirates come to mind immediately) have a ton of young players that produce offensively, and make outstanding defensive plays to boot.

Toronto, Detroit, Kansas City, Texas... all teams that "didn't matter" last season, all of which are above .500, and all of which are leading their respective divisions (Det. and KC are tied currently).  Plus, the Yankees are sub-.500.  Yes, it's only May 12, but I take what victories I can get.

 

Downs: Roger Clemens.

Here's all I have to say about it... his direct quote - "My family has a history of heart conditions... my step-father had a heart attack."

I hope to God that your PR department didn't tell you to say that... if they did, get a new one.  And if you said that on your own... well, listen to the PR people.  That's why you hired them.

You're not playing baseball.  This is like Pete Rose betting on baseball, finally coming out a few years ago.  Shut up and go away, please.
