Today marks my 40th post here on this blog, as well as my first post since breaking 2,000 pageviews... thanks to all of you for viewing and reading all of my ramblings that I actually manage to write down.  But enough chit chat... we've got things to cover.

1) Obviously the biggest story right now is Terrell Owens signing with the Buffalo Bills.  This was something that I even thought as a possibility... I mean, really... the Bills?  Yes, they only had 26 touchdown receptions the past 2 years (2nd fewest in the league, only ahead of the Titans).  But really... the Bills?  Trent Edwards will be throwing him the football this coming season.  You know what school Edwards went to?  Me either... let me go look it up.  Ok, he went to Stanford.

I think both this signing and the Manny signing are showing us the way sports and the economy are mixing here.  Both Scott Boras and Drew Rosenhaus "claimed" that there was a market for their players, and yet ended off signing for relatively low amounts for such star players (2 yrs, $45m for Manny, and 1 yr, $6.5m for Owens).  Is this the economy?  Is this the fact that both players are considered "problem players"?  I think it's both.  No one wants to spend excessive amounts of money on aging, problem players anymore, no matter how much better it can make their team.

So what's the season going to bring?  My guess is... not much.  Owens won't play against the Eagles, Cowboys, or 49ers, so there won't be any of that drama there.  No offense, Trent Edwards, but you're not exactly the highest quality quarterback, so I'm not expecting anything outstanding here.  The only possibility I can see happening is that Edwards has a career year (with a target like that to throw to, there's no reason it couldn't happen), gets a contract extension/raise, and then goes back to a mediocre tenure in the NFL.  Nothing to write home about.

- UConn was ranked #1 many times this season in the polls, and yet they're #3 in their own tournament.
- Pitt seems to have UConn's number this season, beating them in both regular season matchups.  The first game was all about Blair dominating Thabeet, but today's matchup featured just about every member of the Pitt Panther basketball team.  They play pedal-to-the-metal basketball, and never slowed down all game.
- In my mind, the Big East has already gotten 7 locks to the dance; Louisville, Pittsburgh, Connecticut, Villanova, Marquette, Syracuse, and West Virginia.  If Providence can show a little moxie in the Big East tournament (which, by the way, should be nothing short of a spectacular display of basketball), the Big East could easily have 1/8th of the entire field of the NCAA tournament (sorry, I still don't count the 65th ranked team).
- Notre Dame and Georgetown were both ranked in the AP Top 10 this season.  They'll be seeded 10 and 12 in the Big East tournament, respectively.

It's a shame that other conferences can't produce such quality top to bottom like the Big East this year.  Hopefully in the future, we'll see races like this from all the major conferences.

3) Andy Katz is probably thankful that the Missouri Valley Conference tournament is a week before Selection Sunday.  This gives him a few days to learn about the rest of the teams (most notably Northern Iowa... sorry, I know, a little bias coming into play here) in the league and pretend to know a thing or two about the mid-majors.  If picking the higher seed to advance to the final game of a conference tournament and claiming that "70% of the teams" in the league have a chance of "upsetting Creighton or Northern Iowa" is all that it takes to be a senior writer for ESPN... well, sign me up now.

4) I'm calling this right now... the best upset this year in the NCAA tournament will be a 13 over a 4 seed.  Not saying it will happen... but the top 12 teams (i.e. 1-3 seeds) are just too stacked this year.  Getting down into the 4 seed is when the possibilities start for the lower-seeded teams.  If you make it in as a 14-16 seed... well, enjoy the trip to the dance, congratulations, but don't unpack your bags.

I had a lot more to write about, but the Big East got me way too riled up.  I'm going to be taking some time off to search for a new job.  When I see big news, I'll be sure to post.
