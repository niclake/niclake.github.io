![](images/fantasy-football1.gif)How the hell did the 5th pick in my 10-team fantasy league (with snake draft) manage to snag Drew Brees, Marques Colston, and Chris Johnson?

Better question: How are those 3 players outscoring my entire fantasy team right now?  They have 26, 25, and 37 points at the moment, and all 3 still have at least 25 minutes of football to play.

Oh, and throw in the fact that my opponent also has Tony Gonzalez (18 points) and the Packers defense (21 points)... ugh.  Can someone please let Greg Jennings catch a pass already?

I should just close my Stat Tracker until the start of the evening football games.  90% of his players are going to be done after the early games, which will leave me playing catchup all night.

Oh, and C. Johnson just busted a 91 yard TD run... he's now got 52 points instead of 37.  Wonderful.

As a general football fan, you've got to be pretty happy with the general level of play across the league.  The Lions, Texans, and Raiders have managed to play pretty decently so far (I say that with a grain of salt... the Raiders and Lions still suck), and some of the matchups we've seen in weeks 1 and 2 have already given us some exciting games.

This fantasy crap is gonna make me pull my hair out, though...

Going into this final game of the day (which is actually the last game any of my players participate in), I have to hope that Marion Barber gets me 115 points, while Nick Folk (the Dallas kicker) doesn't put anything through the uprights all night.  Likelyhood of this happening?  Yeah, I'm not even going to pretend to have any hope.
