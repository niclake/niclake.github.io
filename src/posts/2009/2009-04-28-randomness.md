Before I begin, I have to explain something...

There's a general point to this post, plus a bunch of randomness that will come after it.  However, the reason I actually decided to post is because I nearly severed a finger this evening.  That's right.  Horrible, you might think.  Humiliating and hilarious are better words to use (and also succeed at my attempts to use alliteration... go me).

![](images/marshmallow_mateys.jpg)I don't know how many of you have ever eaten Marshmallow Mateys before, but let me tell you... those damn bags are mighty tricky.  The general point is to rip the top off, then separate the Ziploc-esque pour spout.  Easy in theory.  However, this family size bag that I attempted to open up this evening didn't open like it was supposed to, so I was forced to take a knife and try and cut into that little blue part that you can see on the picture at right.

I succeeded.

You ever get those thoughts that go through your head that say "No, Nic, don't do this?"  Of course you don't... you're not me.  But you get my drift.  I had one of those, but then my stomach growling for sugary goodness overrode my conscience, and my finger nearly came off.  Super.

To top it off, I somehow managed to separate part of the ziploc thing from the bag itself, thus defeating the purpose of a "resealable" bag.

Damnit.

So enough side story... on to the random blatherings of the evening.

![](images/facebook-logo.jpg)Facebook is a great social tool.  It can be used to assist in getting in touch with classmates, stalking checking in on friends, or reconnecting with those you may have graduated X number of years ago (depending on your age).  However, a trend I've seen lately is for professors (one in particular) to access Facebook, and then add some of their students as friends.

Really, this shouldn't be too big of a problem... not as big as, say, some kids and their parents (or other older more seasoned relatives).  However, I think that some people view Facebook as an open forum to say whatever they want about someone, or respond like a college student would because, hey, that's what Facebook is for, right?

The issue is, when you're a "respected" (I say that very tongue-in-cheek) professor at an excellent university, and you just so happen to work in an outstanding department at that excellent university... well, going around acting like a college student (when you probably attended college yourself about, oh, 40+ years ago) is \*not\* a very intelligent thing to do.

A student and a friend of mine decided to play a joke on a professor, stemming from conversations that had occurred during a class regarding a side project of said professor.  While the joke may not have been in good taste, he fessed up to it with no prodding, apologized, and promised not to do it again.  The professor, however, seemed to have a vendetta against this student, and wasn't content keeping this to conversations/e-mails between himself and the student in question.  Rather, he took it to Facebook, commenting on his, the students, and other students' various statuses (many of which had absolutely no relation to the topic in question).

The whole reason I'm bringing this up is because I saw yet another status this evening that was, shall we say, hijacked by this professor and a student that had first-hand knowledge of the disagreement between the prof/student conflict, even though he doesn't know the professor at all.  While the student may have prodded the professor in question slightly, the professor reacted very childishly, and (in my opinion) in an unacceptable manner for a staff member of a credible university such as the University of Northern Iowa.

Life  is... interesting lately.  I'm still super pumped up about going back to school (btw, good luck everyone on their upcoming finals), and I'm starting to get my mentality and such in order for doing so.  I'm taking a good little break from WoW... it's strange how much free time I have when I'm not sitting playing that game.  I almost don't know what to do with myself.  My mother would be so proud of me.

Still looking for that summer job... though I have locked up 2 for the school year (I'll probably only work one, but I've got 2 to pick from at least, so that's a definite plus), both still in the general computer field, so that's a plus.  I've been looking everywhere, and I just can't seem to find anything... it's getting to be just a little bit frustrating.

I've gone golfing twice in the last two weeks, and seen vast improvements in my game (complete with a 100 yard chip on the final hole last week that ended off hitting the pin and stopping 3 feet from the hole... sweetness).  New clubs are something else to add on my wishlist (along with an 8ft foam sack that's gotten bumped up to the top of my list... dang, those are comfortable).  I've made it a personal goal of mine to work for some company that has routine golf outings.

Tornados fascinate me and scare the piss out of me, all at the same time.

Movies are good.  X-men are cool.  CGI (computer generated imaging) makes movies absolutely amazing.  You cannot have 2 of 3, however, and enjoy the experience.  My roommate got a ripped copy of the new X-men movie, lacking the CGI finishing touches.  I see Wolverine's stunt double thrown in front of a truck, a computer generated gray dummy tumble over the top of the truck, and then Hugh Jackman hit the ground.  I couldn't stop laughing the rest of the movie.

Money is still the bane of humanity (with the Yankees a close 2nd).

Speaking of sports, the Red Sox are on an 11 game winning streak, including a 3 game sweep of the Yanks at Fenway.  Hot sauce.

I'm making it a personal goal of mine to drink at least 2 liters of water a day now.  I'm attempting to get healthy and in shape as much as I can before school starts, so that when I start utilizing the WRC again, I won't feel like a total wuss.  I'm eating better, and I've dropped 7 pounds in just the last 2 weeks alone, but I'm still drinking pop/sugary drinks that aren't really doing me much good.

Along those lines... I've come to the realization that I can't drink Coca-Cola anymore without feeling ill.  Pepsi either (though I wouldn't go that route unless absolutely necessary).  It's not carbonated beverages, because Fresca/Diet Coke/Mt. Dew don't affect me like this.  Guess this is just God's way of telling me "Hey fatty, less sugar!"

More to come, I'm sure... so much time, so little to do.
