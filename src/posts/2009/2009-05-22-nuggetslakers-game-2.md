![Picture 2](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-2.png?w=300 "Picture 2")To be honest, I'm getting sick of this series already.  Both teams are insanely bipolar, and while at times it makes for great drama, other times it gets really really boring to watch.  Can we just spot the Lakers a 2 point lead, and just play the 2nd half?  We could watch more of the Cavs doing trick shots and what have you.

I agree w/ Jeff Van Gundy (ESPN Broadcaster).  Good work by the officiating crew of not calling a flagrant foul on Kenyon Martin's foul of T.Rez.  He caught a tiny piece of elbow while trying to play the ball, and Trevor hit the deck hard.

Speaking of hitting the deck, right as I started writing this post, Fisher decided that he'd make a better floor mat or dodgeball than shooting guard. He hit the floor numerous times, a handful of those due to bouncing off of Nené.  Here's a tip, Fish; guys that big don't like to move unless you're dangling a Twinkie in front of their eyes.

Starting the 4th quarter, the score is 81-80.  I believe it was Bill Plaschke that predicted that this game would be a Lakers blowout...

The Lakers might win, Bill, but it's not going to be by a lot.

Along those lines... a heads up tip for you Tweeters out there... If you want to boost the number of people following you on Twitter, just get something RT'd by someone covering the NBA Playoffs... in this case, J.A. Adande...

> jadande: RT @[niclake13](http://twitter.com/niclake13) That was about 3 fouls on that last possession Nené leveling Fish, and Kobe shoving someone in the back for that reboundFOUL!

Crappy formatting due to 140 char message length.

By the way... Why don't the Lakers have a black uniform?  Black, with purple letters, white numbers, and gold trim.

I'll be very forward here... Kobe Bryant is incredible.  2 shots here in the 4th quarter (that I've seen, I'm sure there's been more) in which Carmelo Anthony has literally touched Kobe's forehead, and Kobe has risen up and buried the shot in Melo's eye.  Absolutely incredible.  More impressive than LeBron, who has his patented jab-step back-shoot move, simply because a defender is, shall we say, "up in his grill".  No separation.  No screens.  Nothing but elevation and confidence there.

I joke around with some of the guys that I shoot hoops with that to defend them, I'm just going to jump on them.  It seems that, to be successful in defending Kobe, that's what you have to do.  The difference?  I'm 5'6".  Melo (or 99.99999% of NBA players) aren't.

Seriously, Lakers.  C'mon, Nuggets.  Play like this the entire game.  If you still happen to be tied after 46:16 of playtime (like they were before Billups nailed his free throws), then I'll be even happier.

I'm pretty sure sometime in the 2nd half, Billups had a nice talking-to with the Nuggets.  Carmelo may be the prized draft pick, and Birdman might be the fan favorite... but this Nuggets team hands-down belongs to Chauncey Billups.  I'll say it again, Chauncey may be the best trade ever in the history of the NBA, due to the difference that he made for this team.  With AI?  No chance of playoffs.  With him?  Challenging for the Western Conference championship.  He brings leadership, play-making ability, and pure scoring to the team.

And the result?  A 106-103 win for the Nuggets.  Physical game all around, from beginning to end.  I'm totally fine with that, since the refs were consistent the entire time.  If the Nuggets feed off their home crowd and play solid basketball in the first half, they could leave Denver up 3-1.
