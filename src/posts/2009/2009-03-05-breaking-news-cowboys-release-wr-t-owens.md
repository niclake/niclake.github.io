According to Sportscenter, the Dallas Cowboys have released Wide Receiver Terrell Owens.  This was breaking news at 11:00 CST.

 

This is absolutely huge, and I think shows that Jerry Jones may, in fact, be getting his act together and not giving chances to "problem" athletes (Tank Johnson, Adam 'Pacman' Jones, and TO).

UPDATE (via Michael Smith, ESPN): This release is due to a combination of Owens' poor performance last season, as well as his attitude over the past few years.  Owens still has quite a bit of money remaining on his contract, so when Dallas cuts him loose in this situation, you know something is up.

 

Want to guess if the Raiders make a stab at him?

My personal "legit contender" guess that might pick him up... Bengals (doubtful), Browns, Chiefs (match up with Cassell), Giants (to replace Plaxico).  Giants would be my primary guess of someone that would be interested.
