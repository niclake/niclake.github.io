In my free time, I am one of the moderators of the [Vikings Yahoo group online](http://sports.groups.yahoo.com/group/vikings/).  One of the members there kindly paid for and hosted a Fantasy Football league (yeah, he paid for it... kinda insane, but I'll roll with it), and as a moderator, I was invited to participate.  Now, I've never done much in the way of fantasy sports before this calendar year.  I joined 2 fantasy baseball leagues this year, one of which I care about a little bit (currently 7th of 10 players) and one which I don't give a crap about (2nd of 10).  Baseball is just such a long season, it's hard to keep up with it all.

Anyway, we had our Fantasy Football draft today, and I have to admit, my team looks pretty solid overall.  When I logged on this morning, I was pretty shocked to find out I'd won the random draw for first overall pick, so that was definitely nice.  Here's the team I drafted:

QB: Kurt Warner (Ari) RBs: Adrian Peterson (Min), Marion Barber (Dal) WRs: Greg Jennings (GB), DeSean Jackson (Phi) WR/TE: Dallas Clark (TE, Ind) WR/RB: Roy Williams (WR, Dal), Willie Parker (RB, Pit) K: John Kasay (Car) DEF/ST: Tennessee Bench: David Garrard (QB, Jac), Beanie Wells (RB, Ari), Shonn Greene (RB, NYJ), Laveranues Coles (WR, Cin), Michael Jenkins (WR, Atl), Jeremy Maclin (WR, Phi)

I've pulled out 2 stud RBs, 3 solid WRs, a great TE, an excellent QB and defense, and a bench with some solid potential.  Thinking I may have to make a trade for a good #3/4 RB, since I'm not really sure how much my rookies (Beanie and Shonn) will play, and I'm worried one of my starters are going to get hurt.

In other exciting news... college football starts in a week.  I can't even explain how excited I am.
