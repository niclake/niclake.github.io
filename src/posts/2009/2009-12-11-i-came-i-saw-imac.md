iKnow... very creative.

My new 27" iMac arrived today.  A full 5 days ahead of schedule.  I'm so unbelievably happy right now.

The old laptop actually gave out on me in the middle of the week, so this was absolutely perfect timing.  Mom was nice enough to let me have the computer now (she was going to hold onto it until after I was done with finals, but I really do need it in order to study... I can't watch my physics lectures anywhere else), so I stopped over after my Macro test to pick it up.

Brought it back to the dorms, un-boxed it, tore down the laptop and got this thing set up...

I got everything pretty much to where I wanted it, though I'll definitely need to tweak some things after I'm done with all my finals.

A couple of things that I've noticed/realized:

- A 27" screen is rediculous.
- This computer takes up half of my desk.
- I used to think my external monitor was bright (compared to my PowerBook).  Now it looks like crap compared to this.  Apple Cinema Display, anyone?
- I was disappointed, because I borrowed my mom's camera, but forgot to get the card reader.  Lo and behold, SD Card reader built right into the side of the computer.  Hot!
- The new Magic Mouse from Apple... oh my word.  I'm in love with this thing.

Oh, and the joke.  Laura (an RA in the building) poked her head into my room right after I got this set up, and practically yelled "Oh my God, that's huge!"  5 neighbors from 3 separate rooms all responded at the same time, "That's what she said."  This is why I love college.
