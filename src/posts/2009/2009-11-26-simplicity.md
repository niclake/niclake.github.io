There truly is something to be said for simple, in every aspect of life.  It's funny when I actually look at my life and examine where I'm succeeding and where I feel I'm failing, and actually analyzing how complex I'm making things.  (This was actually a revelation to me as I was writing this post, so bear with me.)  Like right now, I'm attempting to write this blog post, and I've got about 20 tabs open with different ideas that I want to incorporate into this post, and I didn't know where to start.  So I just looked through them all, and cut it down to 4 tabs of things I need.  Simple, right?

I remember back in the day when I used to mess with my computers all the time.  I've always been a guy that's enjoyed having as much information as possible accessible to me at a glance.  I remember playing World of Warcraft, and having my interface set up for my healing paladin... [I would show people my UI, and they'd always say "Holy crap, there's so much stuff!"](http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/3725/wowscrnshot042209220038.jpg).  But for me, it worked perfectly... any info that I would need during a given session would be available, right at my fingertips.  I look at that now, and think "holy crap... that really is a lot of stuff".  I'm sure I could've made do with so much less, but there's no way in hell I'm going back and playing that soul-consuming game again.  Anyway... I was the same way back in the early college days of having my Mac.  I wanted everything available, and I wanted it \*now\*.  I'm still the same way now, but I've been able to find less space-clogging and more eye-appealing ways of displaying all my info.  My "then and now" screenshots are below... click to get the big pictures (see what I did there?).

As you can see, things have gotten more... elegant?  Clean?  I guess if I was really going for the minimal/simplistic look, I'd put up a wallpaper that didn't dazzle me every time I looked at it.  Even with me simplifying everything, I still try to make things look as good as possible... if I'm going to use something every day, then it has to look good (that's my feeling, anyway).  I still have every piece of info that I need on a constant basis right there at my fingertips, tucked away up in the menu bar.  I can launch any application or open any document, song, or folder with just a few short keypresses (thanks to Quicksilver).  Everything is blended all pretty and nice.  My applications are even more "streamlined" now.  I would rather have 1 application do something extremely well rather than doing a bunch of things just so-so.  If I need to jot something down, I'll just open Stickies (though now, I use Evernote a lot more, since it's got a lot of very handy features, as well as internet backups).

I did the same thing with music as well.  I've always loved to have all sorts of different toys and effects available to me, and I've always been in awe and drooled over massive pedalboards.  A couple weeks ago, I stripped my setup down to about as simple as I could possibly go... a distortion pedal and a delay pedal, running through a Hot Rod Deluxe.  That was probably the most fun I've had playing guitar in a long long time.  You can't hide behind the bells and whistles, and suddenly that forces you to be more thoughtful, more creative, more productive.

There really is a lot of benefit to making things simple in your everyday life.  Why take a laptop to class when you have a pencil and paper?  Previous generations pulled it off just fine, and I find that I learn better when I'm forced to write neatly so I can read it later, rather than just type it out.  I mean, I can sit here and write this blog post as I watch The Food Network... I've read and re-read a lot of what I've written and had to modify it, since some of it just rambles on and on and on and on and... oops.  Why do I need all these fancy gadgets and bags and clothes, when the simple things do their job just fine?  (Don't even get me started with fashion... clothes are meant to protect us and keep us warm.  If you want to wear the most low-cut, tight, or revealing clothes, just go naked and save everyone the trouble and yourself a lot of money.)  Why do you need all the effects pedals in the world when your guitar playing can't shine through?  Why do you need that super fancy phone when this one makes phone calls and texts just fine?  (Sue me, I do want an iPhone.)  Keep it simple, stupid.

I think we as a society should really take that to heart.  Keep it simple.  Maybe I should've shortened this blog post in tribute... damn thing took me over 2 hours to write.

On an slightly related note... the band Weaver at the Loom has developed into one of my favorite bands ever since I got their album.  I'm truly amazed at some of the music that my generation has been able to make.  While I can't look at anything that we've done and define it as iconic (like Zeppelin, Floyd, Sabbath, Clapton, or some of the bands that my dad grew up listening to), I can still see brilliance from all of these bands in many different ways.  WatL (surprise, surprise) keeps things extremely simple and stripped down, layering sounds on top of one another to achieve a sound that's indescribable.  You really just have to listen to the video (and watch the pretty pictures as they go by).

Lately I've been staring at the clouds, alive with beauty. Reflecting all that I live, and I can't help but wonder, When will they fade away? Fearing the dark may come my way, turning day back into dreary night, where clouds I'll never see. I will stare 'til I can see no more. With dark approaching, I'm longing for answers to these questions that I pose. When will they fade away? Fearing the dark may come my way, turning day back into dreary night, where clouds I'll never see. (my favorite part) Though outside it's dark and toxic, I'll try not to be afraid. Cuz the stars burn brightly with the hope you give my love. Their bright lights shine like beacons in the sky, guiding me far from this place. Glowing knives cut right through this darkened sky, 'til all that's good refills my gaze
