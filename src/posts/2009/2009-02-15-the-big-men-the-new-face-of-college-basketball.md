There's nothing like the magic of a great shooting guard like [Kyle McAlarney](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=26941) or [Jodie Meeks](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=31683), a great passer and setup man like [Levance Fields](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=27292) or [Ty Lawson](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=31608), or even a great all-around player like [Stephen Curry](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=32284) in the game of basketball... but if you ask any coach, they'll tell you that having a quality man in the middle is just as important.

And so, with the NCAA Basketball tournament a very short month away, I thought I would spend this Valentine's Day expressing the love that many coaches are having this season throughout the league; their undying affection for a great big man to play in their system.  We've been blessed to see a large sample of great big men this year.  5 that come to mind; [Hasheem Thabeet](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=31559) (junior) of Connecticut, [Blake Griffin](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=36259) (sophomore) of Oklahoma, [Luke Harangody](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=36578) (junior) of Notre Dame, [DeJuan Blair](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=36578) (sophomore) of Pittsburgh, and [Tyler Hansbrough](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=27018) (senior) of North Carolina.

Of these five notable big men, four of them are averaging a double-double; Hansburough (21.8 points/game, 7.8 reb/game) has seen his minutes drop this season (29.4, down from 33 last year) due to the dominant overall play of UNC through the entire season.

Griffin (22.1 points/game, 13.8 reb/game) is arguably the premiere big man in the sport this year, leading his team to a #2 ranking (AP) at 25-1.

Harangody, while having very impressive stats (24.6 points/game, 12.8 reb/game), suffers from a team that lost 7 straight, all of them by at least 7 in the tough Big East conference.

Blair (15.3 points/game, 12.6 reb/game) suffers from  key factors; his lack of experience, and being on a very well-balanced Pitt team (23-2, #4 in the current AP poll).  As only a sophomore, though, he's still got 2 years to continue to improve and build upon his success.

However, my favorite player of the season (and potentially the future) is Thabeet.  While he doesn't have the highest stats (13 points/game, 10.5 reb/game), he's in the same boat as Blair, having a very well established team around him to score and pester the opposing team, allowing Thabeet to stand in the middle at his 7-3 height and deter anyone who comes into the paint.  While they don't show up on the stat sheet anywhere, all it takes is watching one UConn basketball game to see how much he dominates underneath the basket on the defensive end; big men will put up floaters instead of going up strong, smaller guards will turn away from their drives and kick the ball back out instead of trying to get around him.

A quote I heard from coach Jim Calhoun a few weeks back regarding Thabeet; "He's so raw, he came to us with no bad habits to break... which is great for us."  And it shows too.  No jumping after fadeaways.  No excessive handchecking.  Just straight-up, honest defense under the hoop, something that many analysts say they haven't seen since the days of Patrick Ewing.

Granted, none of these big men are anything without a guard to set them up, shooters to stretch the defense and keep them honest, or a good coach and system to work in.  Seeing such an abundance of these giants in the game, however, gives us a different aspect of the game to watch, to learn, and to understand.  No more isolated incidents of one or two giants and a plethera of slashers, shooters, and passers; we now slowly seeing the game move towards one of balance and power, towards team play and not as much one-on-one matchups.  This is a great thing for the game of basketball, both on the collegiate and professional level, as it lends to more excitement for the fans.

Hopefully this trend is one that is here to stay.
