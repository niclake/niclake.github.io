There are days that I really wish I wasn't as nice of a person as I am.

I always try to help my friends out when I can, because that's the kind of person I am.  Like today... if I'd taken my wallet with me, I would've paid for Doug's gas when we ran out heading to play disc golf (a side note: Tourist Park being closed for practically 2 weeks kinda sucks).  Or if I've got friends over, sure, they can bum a pop/Kool-aid out of my fridge.  Simple things.

This week, we were out at the Gold Falls pool, just kinda hanging out.  When you're around the pool, you kinda expect things to happen.  I was joking that someone should push my friend in the pool, since he'd already shoved me in (I wanted to get in anyway, so it wasn't a big deal).  Some guy that Doug and I work with came over and shoved my friend into the pool, while he had his wallet and cell phone in his pocket.  I'm not sure if anything happened to his wallet, but his phone got destroyed by the water.  Obviously, the guy that pushed him in didn't know that he still had his phone on him, but everyone out at that particular pool was inebriated in some way.  I thought that a fight was going to go down, but instead, my friend just said "I'll go get a phone tomorrow, we'll be in touch, and you're paying for my phone", and the guy said "Ok man, that's cool, your friends can get ahold of me".  And we could.  Both Doug and I work at Hy-Vee, and he works in Doug's department, so I figured yeah, we got it taken care of.

Apparently, this guy doesn't remember anything of that day.  When I went in to talk to him today, his claim was "Oh, I don't remember anything about that, I'm not paying for a damn thing".

.... What a tool.

I acquired the guy's phone number by some slightly shady means, since he wasn't going to give it out (remember, he "didn't do it"), and I almost feel obligated to contact the guy and tell him to man up and take care of this issue, even though it wasn't my phone.  I gave my friend his number, and he says "well, you know him, so you talk to him and get my money" (about $160).

o.O

Large groups of intoxicated people.  A pool.  Electronics.  Something bad is just bound to happen.  I almost wish it had been my cell phone, since I still had insurance and I wouldn't hesitate to get in the guy's face and make him give me my money, or take him to small-claims court if he didn't.

Just a rant.  Nothing really coming out of this.  Doug told me I shouldn't get involved in this, but I did because I'm nice and wanted to help my friend out.  Blah.
