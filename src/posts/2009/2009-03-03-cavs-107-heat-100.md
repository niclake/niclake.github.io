Can I name 2 MVPs, just for tonight?

Please?  Can I?

Fine, I'll do it anyway.

On the anniversary of Wilt's 100 point performance, LeBron James and Dwayne Wade put on an absolute show.  The Cavs threw down 31 points in the 4th quarter, turning a 4 point deficit into a 7 point victory, and both of these players were absolutely incredible.  Check these stat lines.

James - 42 pts, 8 rbs, 4 ast, 1 stl, 1 blk Wade - 41 pts, 7 rbs, 9 ast, 7 stl, 1 blk (and man, was it a sweet block)

Both players were absolutely marvelous, having great drives, dishes, and dunks between the both of them.  However, we expect this out of them night after night, and while it's rare to see two flashy stars go at it like this, it's happened (I realize the Suns/Lakers game was good.  However, Shaq has been called many things in his past... flashy is not one of them).  It's great to see role players step up and contribute big in situations like this... which brings me to my MVP (I guess really only of this game, but still)...

Mo Williams - 30 pts, 7 rbs, 7 ast, 2 stl

30 points.  30!  And get this... the LeBrons (I guess I have to stop calling them that now) Cavaliers were down by 2 with 7:42 left in the game.  Who went off?  James?  Sorta... he had a monster dunk to seal the game.  Nope, it was Mo Williams, drilling 2 3's in a row and scoring 15 of his points to close out the game.

Now, obviously, Williams is not option numero uno by any stretch of the imagination.  When it comes down to crunch time, LeBron gets the ball (more on this in a moment).  But Mo Williams has proven himself.  He is growing into his role, and becoming as much of a key factor to this game as James is.

The Cleveland Cavaliers would not be 35 games over .500 without either James \*or\* Williams.  Shocking, I know.

And about James... When you're as big as he is, what do you think you'd do with the basketball in the crunch time?  In the past, James would dribble, sit outside, try and cross a guy over and then jack up a 3 pointer.  When he hit them, people claimed "Oh, what a great shot!".  When he missed, people said "Well, that shot was a high degree of difficulty."  No.  Just, no.  Michael was a good sized dude in his own right, but he proved time after time that he could take people off the dribble, and had no issue shooting perimeter three pointers or mid-range jumpers.

But James, the past two game, has done absolutely the right thing.  Off the dribble, \*DRIVE THE LANE\*, and attack the rim.  Tonight's dunk over Jermaine O'Neal just happened to be one of his best dunks ever.  He did this in his last game as well... this time, he took a foul, and made 1 of 2 at the line to close the game.

To the Cleveland Cavaliers... I apologize.  I wrote you off as being nothing but silly little pawns out defending King James on the court.  You have proven me wrong.

James still gets my season MVP pick, though.
