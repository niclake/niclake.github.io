Right now, there is all this talk about the Big Ten expanding to 12 schools.  The primary reason for this was made very apparent this football season, that being that football doesn't have a playoff, and therefore our quality teams (Ohio State, Iowa, and Penn State) suffer from inactivity.  2 questions need to be tackled before this can be accomplished, though.

**![](images/big_ten_map.gif)1) Who's the team? ([check out the maps](http://www.sconefest.com/john/football.html))**

The logical question.  Who do we pick up?  There are a couple factors to consider.  The Big 10 is a conference that prides themselves on academic and athletic excellence.  All 11 schools have won at least 1 national championship in a sporting event in the last 11 years.  Location is also key.  Spreading the conference out extremely far, especially during these tough economic times, isn't something that I think the conference would like to do.  While there's no set-in-stone requirements for being a member of the Big Ten, they're not going to just take anyone.  I'm going to go through conference-by-conference and tell you who I think would be logical to join.  (Remember, this is more than just football.  This is all sports.)

**INDEPENDENTS**: Right now would be the perfect time to swoop in and grab Notre Dame.  The talks for years and years are "why would an independent school with its own TV contract and inclusion into the BCS desire a conference?", but those were when Notre Dame was outstanding good decent not the worthless pile that it seems to have become.  Guaranteed money coming in from other teams playing in bowl games.  Even more national news attention.  Great location (northern Indiana), though it would make splitting the conference into 2 divisions might be slightly more difficult (maybe Indiana teams + OSU + Penn St. + Illinois in the "South" division).  Academic excellence.  Guaranteed great games (vs. OSU and Penn St. every season?  Hell yes), and you can still make your own pre-season schedule.  However, Notre Dame is not a part of the Association of American Universities, an extremely exclusive organization of the top doctoral research institutions of Canada and the United States, and the Big Ten bylaws state that anyone joining the conference would have to be a member of the AAU.

\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\* Apparently the Notre Dame athletic director doesn't read my blog, because otherwise he may have considered this.  As it is, ND has stated that they are "happy being independent".  Right.

**Atlantic Coast Conference**:  Nope.  Steering clear.  Bringing in a Va Tech/Virginia/Maryland might be interesting (think of Maryland during basketball season!), but the extra distance is (in my opinion) just a little much.

**Big 12**:  Iowa State is the logical choice here (leading to even more in-state squabbling... ah, high school), with Missouri as a potential backup.  Nebraska has too much Big 12 history to leave.  The key here would be if the Big 12 could pick up another quality school, like a TCU, Houston or Boise State.  Come to think of it, if they managed to acquire TCU, the state of Texas would need to work on annexing Oklahoma.  Then you could have the Big 12 North, and the Big 12 Texas (Texas, T Tech, TA&M, Baylor, TCU, "Oklahoma").  This would be a win in multiple respects...

1. Big 10 gets their 12th team.
2. Big 12 makes themselves stronger (let's face it, TCU > Iowa State... at least in football).
3. TCU puts themselves in perfect contention for a BCS game (though it makes their road more difficult by having to play in the Big 12), allows them to recruit better, and make more money.

I honestly think that this is one of the better solutions.  The BCS would win too, because there would be less controversy in terms of non-automatic qualifiers trying to break in.

Come to think of it, the state of Texas should just make their own conference.  They could even take over the Big Ten name...

- Texas
- Texas Tech
- Texas A&M
- Baylor
- TCU
- UTEP
- Southern Methodist
- Houston
- Rice
- North Texas

Yikes.

**Big East**: Another strong possibility for the Big Ten to raid, though with the shakeups that they have had last season, I'm not sure what the likelihood of this would be.  Cincinnati, Pitt, West Virginia, and Louisville would all be logical choices in terms of location.  Think of the juiciness of West Virginia playing, and opening their season against Rich Rodriguez and Michigan.  Yummy.  I personally would be chasing Pitt, though any of these teams would be an extremely appealing option.  There are also talks of Rutgers and Syracuse to be targets of the B10, if only because of the New York media and the extra exposure the conference would get from that move.

**Conference USA**: Maybe Marshall?  That's all I've got.

**Mid-American Conference**: All teams have the location.  None have the athletic prestige in my mind to truly fit with the Big Ten.  If you twisted my arm, I'd just cry a little and ask you politely to move on.

**Mountain West**: Whoever had the idea of inviting TCU was just dumb.  Location, location, location!

**PAC 10**: Same issue.  Location.

**Southeastern Conference (SEC)**: Screw location.  If you could get any of those teams to be dumb enough to leave that conference, I will sign them in an instant.  Kentucky?  Arkansas?  Vandy?  Tennessee?  Yes please.

**Sun Belt**: Location + lack of athletic prestige = not likely.  Western Kentucky would really be the only option here... plus, their mascot is badass.

**Western Athletic Conference**: Nope.  Not even Boise State.

And since I know my reading audience, I'll play a little favoritism here...

**FCS (former D1-AA) schools**:  Northern Iowa has the athletic excellence (playoffs in football 3 of 5 years, Missouri Valley champions in basketball/NCAA tournament frequent visitor, women's volleyball), as well as the academic prestige to fit.  However, size-wise, we lack a lot.  A LOT.  Other potential options would include Southern Illinois (Missouri Valley), Cornell (Ivy League), or Villanova (Colonial South), and \*maybe\* Georgetown (Patriot).  However, the most appealing additions (Villanova/Georgetown) are probably more strongly desired for their basketball teams, rather than football, which is why we're having this whole debate in the first place.

If I had to list my top... let's say 5, in order of highest desire as well as most likely, I would go in this order:

1. Pitt
2. Notre Dame Iowa State (though it would take some help from TCU/Houston/similar team)
3. Cincinnati
4. Louisville
5. Northern Iowa Syracuse (Face it, Panthers... we would get our butts handed to us for at least 4 years, and we would need a new stadium.)

**2) What's the name?**

It's dumb enough that we call ourselves the Big Ten when we have 11 teams.  Seriously, this is a conversation I had with a friend a few minutes ago:

> Me: So if the Big Ten gets another team, what would they call themselves? Them: Heaven Eleven?  Big Eleven? Me: Nono, they've already got 11.  They'll have 12. Them: ???

I was kinda confused on that when I was younger too.  I hate math, but even I understand 10 ≠ 11.

I've always been partial to the "Better 12" conference, though I'm sure that would get current Big 12 teams pretty riled up.  Maybe the MCC (Mid-Continental Conference)?  WDC (Water-Deprived Conference... though we do have the Mississippi/Great Lakes)?  Great Lakes Conference?  Throw some of your ideas my way.

Overall, I'm happy to see the Big Ten making these strides, and I truly hope that this comes to pass.  I can't wait to see who the Big Ten decides to pursue in this deal.
