I'll let everyone else recap the game for you.  I just have a few things to say.

1) That was, hands down, the best single sporting event that I have ever watched in my entire life.  Yes, this even beat the Red Sox vs. Yankees, 2004, game 7 ALCS.

2) I agree with Tim Cowlishaw (I have him on Twitter)... the conference tournaments are extremely underrated.  Some teams (Baylor) are scrapping for a chance to dance.  Some teams (Syracuse) want to prove that they're not a team to be messed with.  The Big 12.  The Big East.  All sorts of phenomenal games played today.  I didn't work today either... epic.

3) As critical as I've always been of referees... there was no better way to call this game.  A few slop calls (UConn slightly bumping a Syracuse player above the 3 point line and getting whistled), but that was in the 2nd overtime.  They let the players settle this on the court, kept things calm, and made the right calls when they had to.  Well done.

4) Syracuse is my dark horse in the NCAA tournament.  If you take rankings and give out straight seeds, Syracuse gets the final 5 seed (they're #20 in the polls right now).  If UNI gets these guys in the opening round, I might cry.

5) Eric Devendorf is a punk, a straight-up thug.  I admire his skills on the court, but seriously dude... shut your mouth.  Stop talking.  Play the game the way it's meant to be played.  Watching you gloat after making a couple of 3's makes me sick.

6) I was about to shut this game off with about 3 minutes to go, but I decided not to.  An hour and a half later, it was over.  Yeesh.

Watching that made me tired.  It's time to sleep.

This game will be on ESPN Classic... if you missed it, you should watch it.
