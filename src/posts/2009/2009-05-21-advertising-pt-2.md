Last night I [showed an advertisement for Rolling Rock beer](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2009/05/20/advertising/), and talked about "advertising done right" and how it sticks with you.  Proof?  I heard "Heartbeats" by José Gonzalez on an episode of Scrubs this evening, and it reminded me of one thing...

Do yourself a favor and watch that in HD (I had to look around for a version that was actually of good quality).  There's also a ["making of" video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KPjWZQ1lp0) that's pretty cool to watch as well.

No lie... this is one of the most epic things I've ever seen in my entire life.
