Something happened last night that really changed my opinion on a lot of things...

From Fall '06 to Spring '08, I was a computer science student at UNI.  I didn't like it, mostly because I couldn't stand the programming that was forced upon us.  We started learning a programming language called C, which I loved.  Took me a while to grasp it, but once I did, I went full force into it, having assignments done in 1 night, or working on my final for the better part of 2 months.

There's actually a good joke about my final... I "brute forced" that program, adding about 4000 lines of code that I literally could parse down to about 400.  However, I never fully understood the method needed if I was to trim it down (mostly because of the teacher not really teaching, so much as just talking), so I didn't.  It ended off that I e-mailed my final to my professor, and he printed it out... all 97 pages of it.  Then he accidentally printed it out 2 more times.  The department yelled at him for using too much paper.

Anyway... after C, we were thrown into C++.  Not much difference, but enough that it threw me for a loop.  Never did get a grasp on that.  Then Ada.  I'd heard horror stories about Ada, and they weren't kidding.

I think it was more about the environment I was in that confused the hell out of me.  I wouldn't mind going back and learning C, C++, and Ada (well, maybe not Ada)... but not over the course of 3 semesters.  I've got other things to worry about.

So anyway, I swore that I hated coding, and that I'd never go back to doing it again.  And I put my foot down.

Last night, I was talking with one of my friends about my project (he's a comp. sci. major as well), and how I kinda wish I had it on my computer so I could laugh at it a little more.  He was like "is it something like 5700 lines long?"  "Uh... yeah."  \*\*Do you want to accept file transfer of 'project.c'?\*\*

/jaw drop

Apparently, I'd sent him a copy of my final so he could look it over before I turned it in, and he'd never deleted it off of his computer (obviously, he has a lot more hard drive space than I do).  I busted it out, looked at how bloated the code was, and thought "hrm, I should fix this".  But Shawn has all my C books... plus, maybe I should try something new, and give myself a fresh start.

So with that... coupled with the fact that I literally have been bored out of my mind for the better part of a month+, I've determined that I'm going to learn a new programming language.  Really, all I do throughout the course of the day is job hunt.  I'm up way late, I multitask all the time, and having something more productive to do would be super.

So now it's just a matter of picking the language I want to learn.  I've been given a couple of ideas... Java, Ruby, Objective-C, PHP, or possibly even SQL.  I'm not really sure what to choose yet... still gotta figure out the pros/cons/uses of all of those.  (If I learned Objective-C, I could go work for Apple... oooooo.)

All you CS majors out there... Any thoughts/suggestions on what I should do?
