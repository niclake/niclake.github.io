I'm going to be really honest with you all today...

I'm getting really annoyed with officials in all leagues.

You look at today's Vikings/Steelers game.  Vikings were driving, inside the 10, and got called for a tripping call on a TD pass.  There was absolutely no trip on the play.  The Vikings lineman got flattened, rolled to try and get back up, and some greedy Steeler tried to hurdle him and failed.

Or you look at the Defensive Delay of Game that was called.  Pretty sure no one moved, so I don't know how this penalty was called.

I'm really happy Dugan flattened that line judge on Harvin's kickoff return.  That's the one that called the trip just 2 plays earlier.

Or what about the umpires in MLB?  Blowing tons of calls left and right, ones so obvious a 7 year old that's just learning to play can do better.  An easy double play call at 3rd, missed.  Neither was on the base.  Both tagged.  How the hell do you miss that?  Or the base hit that was really a foul ball off the batter.  Etc. etc.

Look, I realize that being a ref/umpire is difficult.  They have split seconds to make a decision that we get to critique for a week afterwards.  But I'm starting to agree with Shawn a little more.  We had a debate this summer that has continued off and on throughout the semester about how the various sports should include more forms of electronic monitoring/instant replay.  While there's something historic about the human element being a part of the game, these blunders are just stupid and easily correctable.

Here's the kind of water cooler talk I'd like to hear... "Hey, did you see that game between the Steelers and the Vikings?  It was incredible!!!"

... and not... "Hey, did you see that game between the Steelers and the Vikings?  The refs really gave that game away..."

Good refs/umps are the ones that go completely unnoticed during the course of the game.  Make the correct calls, and get off the field.  When we talk about you the following morning at work, or hear about it on Sportscenter, that's when people like me get really annoyed.

You look at today's Vikings/Steelers game.  Vikings were driving, inside the 10, and got called for a tripping call on a TD pass.  There was absolutely no trip on the play.  Dugan (Vikings FB) went for a block, went low, and some greedy Steeler tried to hurdle him and failed.  Feet flailed out, and so the refs called a trip.
