Did you know that the odds of getting the correct bracket for the NCAA tournament are 9.2 quintillion to 1?  And if every human being on the planet picked a different bracket, we would still only have a 1 billion to 1 chance of getting it correct?

Seeing those stats made me feel better about myself.  I came home this evening to 3 e-mails from my father gloating about how he was beating me.  This is a man who enjoys his sports, but doesn't have nearly the time that I do to watch/follow/analyze them like I do.  And he had better picks than I did!  Rawr!  He may still be ahead of me... I honestly haven't seen his bracket yet.

VCU almost pulled one out for me, and Western Kentucky decided to try to choke their game away (thankfully, Illinois didn't let them).  Both 16 seeds got trounced, and the 15 seeds were slapped around pretty convincingly.  Clemson obviously doesn't like me (I missed that game), Northern Iowa goes 0-3 all time against the Big Ten in the NCAA tournament and winless since 2004 in the 1st round, losing yet again by 5 points (it was a common theme for us this year).

Tomorrow's games, I'm still confident in.  There are a few games that I'm a bit worried in... Florida State/Wisconsin, Arizona State/Temple, and Utah/Arizona (seriously... AZ squeaked in.  Why is everyone picking them?).  2 1/16, 2 2/15, and 3 3/14 games tomorrow should pad my bracket nicely.

A friend of mine made a good point... my bracket is very Big East/ACC heavy (his is even worse), and woeful on the PAC 10.  This is a problem that is hopefully remedied in the upcoming seasons.
