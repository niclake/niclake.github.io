Kinda surprised I haven't updated recently... almost a week and a half since I've written anything.  I blame Shawn and Jessa for not writing anything in their blogs.

So the harrowing experience of my summer is finally resolved.  My financial aid money finally arrived about a week ago.  Bills were paid, a little fun was had, and some money was set aside for future plans.  (Side note: as I write this post, Shawn [updated his blog... finally](http://bit.ly/eDWiS).)  I spent the better part of 2 months on my phone with Iowa Student Loans trying to get everything figured out, and it almost feels like there's a gaping whole in my day without speaking to one of their lovely representatives.

Downside... my car brakes died (again!!!).  This winter it was the brake line, and this time it was a caliper leaking fluid.  Some of that nice cushion that I had put away to save up?  Gone.  Rawr.

Another fun moment was yesterday, finding out that the cell phone bill had lovely extra data usage charges tacked on to it.  (For the record, I share my plan with 2 other people.)  While the other two thought that they possibly had utilized some data sharing on their phone, it wasn't nearly the amount listed on their part of the bill... and I knew for certain that I had never used it.  So we called and talked to Sprint Customer Service for a while.  Honestly, I feel like I'm becoming my father more and more every day.  I was very polite and cordial, but I got fed up with getting a runaround really quick.  Eventually I was speaking with a manager who seemed to have no clue what it was that her company was offering.  I knew more than she did by just skimming the fine print.  Anyway, long story short, we went from having $30 of extra data fees on our plan, to getting those removed from our bill, to getting free unlimited data added to our account until our contract is up (over a year from now).  Hot!

Doug is moving into my apartment for the next few weeks.  Should be an interesting time.  Just moved his futon in, now he's back at his old apartment getting the last of the stuff.

Sitting here watching the Cubs right now... this team is part of the reason that I'm glad the season is 162 games long.  In 3 games, the Cubs have 1) won on a walk-off grand slam in the 13th, 2) lost 11-6 on a day with some crazy plays, and 3) have now increased their lead to 9-0 in the bottom of the 7th, all of it starting with a 6-run 1st inning.  Half game back of the Cardinals in the Central, and looking pretty strong.  Maybe their year?  Who knows.  (Side note... # of times Cubs scored 10+ runs before the All-Star break: 2... since the All-Star break: 3... yum.)

The Red Sox, on the other hand, continue to mystify me.  4-7 since the All-Star break, including a 5-game losing streak.  To make matters worse, we're about to run the gauntlet.  2 more games with the Athletics, a series with Baltimore, and then the following series: Tampa Bay, Yankees, Detroit, Texas, Yankees, White Sox, Toronto, Tampa Bay, White Sox, Baltimore, Tampa Bay, LA Angels, Baltimore, Kansas City, Yankees, Toronto, and finish with a 4-game series with Cleveland.  Or, to condense it down... 3 series with Tampa Bay, 3 w/ the Yankees, 2 with the White Sox, 2 with Toronto, 3 with Baltimore, and 1 each with KC, Detroit, LA Angels and Cleveland.

Ouch.

I'm really excited right now.  Cleveland just traded Cliff Lee to the Phillies, who were supposedly in the lead for acquiring Roy Halladay.  The other main candidate to get him?  Boston.  They've already acquired a good bad in Adam LaRoche, and I feel that they're two healthy, quality starting pitcher away from locking up the AL.  Right now, Smoltz, Dice-K and Wakefield are all a little banged up, and we could truly use all of them back in order to be a powerhouse.  But, if we can get two of them, or one and trade for Halladay, I think that will be enough to get us over the edge.

2 days of class to go.  One more looooooooooooooooooooooooong lecture, and then the final on Friday.  I'm excited cause I'm almost done, but kinda wondering what exactly I'm going to do for the next 3 weeks until the fall semester begins.  I'm feeling good about how I've done this summer, and I'm hoping that I can continue this for 3 more years until I get my degree. :-)  I'm also looking forward to having work to do, between class and my job at the business building's computer lab.  Still haven't found a job, since people have essentially a hiring freeze until college students return... or something like that.

I have too many talents and hobbies.  I feel that if I cut about 10 of them out and just focused on the rest, I could be really really successful.  Figuring out which ones to cut, however... kinda rough.

I feel strangely unproductive lately, now that I think about it.  I'm used to sitting at a desk with dual-screens on my computer, being able to multitask very efficiently.  Since I've gone to my Linux laptop in the living room, I haven't had this luxury.  I wish I could save up enough money to acquire an iMac... \*drool\*.

There are so many movies that have either come out recently, or are coming out here in the near future that I really want to see.  The new Terminator, Transformers 2, G.I. Joe, District 9... yes please.

On a side note... I am done playing poker for the foreseeable future.  Tired of losing money to a game that employs as much luck as poker does.
