• He Is Legend's "I Am Hollywood" album is incredible.  Probably one of my personal top 5 of all time, definitely top 10.

• Until I wrote that above statement, I never actually thought what my personal top 10 albums/artists would be... and I still don't.  I would include "The Wall" by Pink Floyd, "The Beatles" (yeah, you know who that's by)... I'm really not sure what else makes that list.  I'd have to think a lot more.

• COLLEGE FOOTBALL STARTS THIS WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!

• I'm actually really looking forward to the NFL season as well, having my fantasy football team to draw me in even further.

• I've definitely been geeking out the last few days... well, I guess that's a relative term.  To many of the people I converse with frequently, what I'm doing is just a drop in the ocean.  Oh well, have to start somewhere, right?  These are some of the projects that I've been doing lately:

- Making both of my computers play nice with each other, in terms of a live-updating calendar, IMAP e-mail (a bigger deal to me than some of you may think), and contacts everywhere.
- Also synchronizing my RSS feed readers as much as possible.  I have found a Mac solution to this, but there is no true Ubuntu solution (since I'm trying to work with [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) doing this... not without a lot of hacking, that is).
- Trying new software.  This has been an ongoing trend over the past few weeks... ditching a few big, bulky programs in favor of more streamlined, simplified, and visually pleasing software.  No longer using [Adobe Air](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/) products for my Twitter (using [Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/) instead), nor am I online all the time checking my RSS feeds (using [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/), switched from [Vienna](http://www.vienna-rss.org/)).
- Along those same lines, configuring existing software to work better has been something I've worked hard on (IMAP'd e-mail, calendar in [Thunderbird](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/thunderbird/), etc.).
- Set up [Jinzora](http://en.jinzora.com/) on my computer.  (For those that are on campus, if you would like to browse/listen to my music, you are more than welcome to, though it won't be up 24/7.  Just point your browser to [http://134.161.94.224:8888/jinzora2](http://134.161.94.224:8888/jinzora2) and log in with username: user and password: nicsmusic.  Note: this only works on campus at this point in time.)  That was a pain in the ass, but I learned a lot through the process of doing this (3 times).

• I'm also really contemplating some web hosting options at this point.  I'd really like to move this blog off of being a Wordpress.com site (just makes it more professional appearing), and I'd be able to put Jinzora somewhere where people everywhere would be able to access it.  Also, I feel that having the hosting would force me to dive in a little deeper with some of this tech that I've been meaning to play with for a long time now.

• All of my Veridian loans have been paid off, thanks to the help of my parents.  Now instead of paying interest out the ass, I just owe Mom and Dad my soul a lot of money.

• For those that didn't know, I sold the POS that was my old Buick Regal.  Wave bye-bye to crazy door handles and... um... yeah, that's about it.  My dad made a good point... that car got me through a lot of stuff.  But it just was too much effort for a poor college student to take care of, so it has been sold to... someone (I guess I actually don't know who it is).  So I got my mom's '96 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and she got an '05 GMC Envoy.

• Lots of activities to start the year.  Couple rounds of disc golf, a few nights of tennis, the occasional trip to the WRC (I need to go a little more), a few bike rides, and open invitations for ultimate frisbee and football.  That, plus the walking across campus (which some days, I swear gives me shin splints or something), and you'd figure I would've lost a little weight... but no.  Some of it's already back on.  Oops.

• School is great.  Macro test Friday, Info Systems is a yawner so far, Humanities should be relatively interesting with all the group work, and Physics is just plain fun and enjoyable (though slightly confusing, but I'm getting the hang of it).  I'd been in a MWF Personal Wellness class, but I was so bored in that class, I got out of it and placed into the online lecture variant.  Awesome.

• Work is great also.  Easy job, allows me to study, and of course the cute ladies visiting the lab (lol).

This week/weekend are going to be interesting.  Went out to The Library last night, got cheap drinks... I felt like a true college student, riding my bike to and from the Hill in order to drink.  Tomorrow night is the celebration of Curt's birthday (he turned 21 on Monday), Friday night should have stuff going on, and Saturday is the UNI/Iowa game (not to mention COLLEGE FOOTBALL!!!!!!  Yeah, it starts this weekend.), so I'll have to find time to stick studying in there as well.

I've determined that this summer, I really would like to take 2ish weeks and drive out to Washington state/Seattle.  Not really sure why... west coast, rain, I hear there's good food... I just want to go.  Maybe make stops in Colorado or someplace as well.  Anyone want to go?
