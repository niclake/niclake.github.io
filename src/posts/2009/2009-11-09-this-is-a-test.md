Just a couple of random notes from the past weeks that I haven't written down (or want to re-hash).

![](images/siren.jpg)\- We have a new test that occurs for the tornado alarms for at least the tower that's directly west of the UNI campus.  Apparently, it now chimes like a grandfather clock, and then speaks to you saying "This is a test, yadda yadda" while the siren is going off.  Ironically, this occurred on November 4th, or the day before the events of "V for Vendetta" were scheduled to take place.  Had a very creepy, 1984-esque feel to it.  I was sufficiently wigged out.

\- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 comes out this evening/tomorrow morning.  I have class at 9:30 tomorrow morning.  I'm really tempted to go to bed around 4 or 5, get up for work from 7-9, sleep until about 11, then go get the game and play it until I have class.  I doubt I will do this (I'll probably just grab an energy drink and pull an all-nighter), but it's amusing to think about.  Call me a geek, I don't care.

\- The alarm here in the Business Building computer lab is about to go off.  We've had a glitch in here since we changed the alarm code, and the physical plant has drug their feet for 2 months getting it fixed.  Mildly annoying, but at least we know how to keep it from going off all morning now.

\- School is great.  Really.  I love school right now.  Sure, there are frustrations and papers and stupid group presentation people and the like, but I truly am enjoying everything that's going on right now.  Just found out this morning that I have now firmly cemented myself into the "A" range in Macro Economics... as long as I don't screw up one of the last 3 tests (which shouldn't be too difficult), I will have just my 2nd "real A" (aka not a music 1-hour credit classes) in college, the first being Computer Science 1.

\- Fantasy Football and NFL/NCAA Pick'em is slowly driving me insane.  NCAA picks this week, I went 1-5.  NFL I went 6-5 (and thankfully still hold the lead).  Fantasy... yeah, I don't even want to talk about it.  Getting jipped out of a win by a statistician, and then getting absolutely stomped the next week because you forgot to start Carson Palmer (40 points) instead of Kurt Warner (15 points)... ugh.

\- Those of you that know me and know my guitar playing, you know that I am a very atmospheric, effects-driven player.  It's fun, and fits in perfectly with where I play mostly (as a lead player for Nazareth Lutheran Church).  Yesterday, for the first time in probably 7 or 8 years, I completely stripped down my setup.  I left my PRS and my Marshall amp at home.  My setup was my Strat, tuner > distortion > delay (the only effect that I utilize all the time), into my friend's Fender Hot Rod Deluxe.  And it sounded amazing.  Doesn't really want to make me simplify my setup at all, but there are times when toys just don't cut it, and you've got to have the chops to actually get the job done (true in life in general, as well as playing guitar).  To reassure yourself of the fact that yes, I have those chops is always satisfying, no matter who you are.

\- I started panicking about 2 weeks ago, wondering what the hell I was actually going to do this summer.  I've contemplated summer classes, but unless I take a minor there's really no need for me to do that (and even with a minor, I'd still be set, only having one semester with more than 5 classes), although I would probably like to ease back a bit towards the end and be able to focus on those upper-level classes.  Anyway, I started looking around for some internship offerings.  Drew and Jessa pointed me to CareerCat, a tool that UNI has set up for companies to post internship/post-graduation job offerings for students to access.  I applied for a bunch of jobs (20?  Probably not too big of a stretch) in one night, and actually heard back from one (the Waterloo Bucks) the following morning, asking if I'd come in and interview.  As I was writing this blog post, I actually got another interview request from the CBE Group in Waterloo.  Kinda excited... the Bucks job has the potential to be extremely busy, very beneficial in terms of experience and knowledge gained, and a lot of fun... plus, I'd get to watch baseball.

\- I thought maybe I'd explain some of the pictures that have been making their rounds as my banner here lately.  Originally I had a picture of a Telecaster up there (fit in with the blog title well, and I really want one), but I decided to mix it up a bit.  For a couple days, I had a picture of a [gnome dangling from a string](http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2009/02/25/gnome/).  It's actually the background of my Linux laptop.  That site (fiftyfootshadows.net) actually has a whole bunch of minimalistic/soothing wallpapers that you can download for your computer, and this was one of the good ones that I found.  The picture that I have currently is actually [one that I took a couple years back](http://niclake13.deviantart.com/art/Pleasure-Town-35438515) (and here is a [B&W version as well](http://niclake13.deviantart.com/art/Pleasure-Town-2-35438523)).  The bus was completely gutted and fitted with beds, TVs, a generator, you name it.  4 college kids lived in it, and would just drive/park around town and call it home.  Due to mechanical issues, they had to stow it somewhere where the cops wouldn't try and tow it, so they ended off parking across the street from my house at their friend's apartment.

\- Completely shocked that Iowa only dropped to #10 in the BCS.  The game against Northwestern was nothing short of pathetic.  Granted, it's tough to rebound from possibly losing your starting QB for the remainder of the regular season, but Iowa just played terrible in general.  Vandenburg couldn't complete a pass, and kept getting excited and overthrowing receivers on deep routes.  We couldn't run the ball effectively.  We had absolutely no answer for Northwestern's running game, which is notorious for giving us fits year in and year out.  We started strong with a TD in the first minute, but couldn't do anything for the rest of the game.  The only reason it was only 17-10 is because we have one of the best punters in the nation.  That was my first Iowa football game that they have lost while I have been in the stadium.
