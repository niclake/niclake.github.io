![](images/woodsmickelson081106-448x266.jpg)Phil: Hey, what's going on, Tiger?

Tiger: What's up, Phil?

P: Happy Easter, by the way.

T: Hey, same to you.  Alright, so... how are we going to do this today?

P: Well, let's give this a shot.  I'll start off on fire, birdie 4, maybe 5 holes, and put some pressure on these nobodies.  I figure if you could stay within a stroke or two, we'll get ESPN to start giving us a bunch of press and get some more people to tune in.

T: I like it.  Does the PGA still have you on that "Don't Win" contract?

P: (unintelligible) Yeah, those (unintelligible) seem to think that letting you get all the glory is gonna keep ratings high and such.  It's a load of bull, if you ask me.

T: No kidding.  To be honest, it gets kinda frustrating hearing "Tiger this, Tiger that, yadda yadda" all the time.  I feel bad for you and some of these other guys.

P: No doubt.  I wish they'd let me get tired of it for a few weeks.

T: Haha I'll bet you would.  Oh hey, did you hear how crazy the execs are being lately?

P: No, what happened?

T: Oh man... they totally want me to wear a knee brace while I'm out here.  You know, try and keep up the "hurt knee" hype.  Really?  A knee brace?  Who am I, Barry Bonds?  I'm not gonna hit myself with my backswing, I don't need that kind of armor while I play.

P: Speaking of which, how's your knee doing anyway?

T: What, this thing?  (jumps up and down) I'm just really annoyed they made me do this surgery thing in the first place.  I mean, they could've just said "Hey Eldrick, why don't you take a little vacation?  We don't need you for about 10 months".  But noooo, I had to actually get the scars and all this stuff.  Man, it's stupid.

P: I hear you, man.  I mean, it's the same sort of thing with our "rivalry".  Are we really supposed to hate each other?

T: I guess.  Bogus, if you ask me.

P: No kidding.  So, did you look at the script?  Who's supposed to win today?

T: No clue.  I only got my lines.

P: Gah, this is so frustrating.  Watch, I'll bet some scrub nobody with like, 1 Tour victory to this point gets it in like, 2 playoff holes or something.

T: Yeah, I hear you.

P: I tell you, ever since Vince McMahon took over for the PGA and started planning out these tournaments for TV ratings...  man, I'm not even having fun anymore.

T: Tell me about it.  And I have to put up with this (censor) instead of being at home with my wife and kids.

P: Yeah, it's rough. Oh well.  I heard that he's got absolutely no support from anyone in management lately.  Hopefully he'll be out of here by the next Major.

T: You'd better hope so.  I heard he's gonna make you start hitting right handed.  Oh hey, we gotta go... it's our tee time.

P: ......... Seriously?  What the hell...
