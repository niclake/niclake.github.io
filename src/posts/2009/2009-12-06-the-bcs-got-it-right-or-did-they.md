![](images/bcsIS.jpg)The BCS sucks.  It really does.  In theory, you'd think that this idea would be great, and would really assist all of us fans in getting to see the top two teams in the nation play each other.  That's what we want after all, right?

Yeah, that plan nearly failed this year.

We were witness to some great football games yesterday.  Georgia Tech held on over Clemson, despite CJ Spiller's best efforts.  Alabama showed the Florida Tebows Gators what was up.  And if you watched it, I don't think I really need to tell you about how amazing the Pittsburgh/Cincinnati game was.  Holy crap.

But then we get into the crap of a game that was Texas v. Nebraska.  Now, I realize that the entire premise of this game was Texas Offense vs. Nebraska Defense.  Frankly, I'm not sure what happened to Texas, but there's no way that this game should've come down to a last-second field goal.  And (seriously, no offense to Nebraska here) if you really are only going to be able to put up 13 points against the Huskers, do you truly think that you deserve the title of the 2nd Best Team in the Country?  I sure don't.

Oh well.  Hey, Colt, Mark Ingram called.  He says thanks for the Heisman Trophy.

Here's one thing that I think the BCS got completely lucky on.  No matter where teams go, we are on course for 5 absolutely outstanding football games this January.  While I don't necessarily agree with some of these placements of teams (you'd figure higher-ranked teams would play each other or something), there's absolutely no denying that these matchups are going to be great.  Here's how I'm projecting that these games will shape out.

- Sugar Bowl (Jan 1) - **Florida**, the loser of the SEC Championship (but still the darlings of NCAA Football right now), vs. **Cincinnati**, the outright Big East champions.  Cincy was sure hoping Nebraska was going to upset Texas, since that would've put them right in the mix, along with TCU and (gasp) Florida to play Alabama in the title game.  Instead, we get to see 2 outstanding college QBs flex their muscles, make strangely prophetic Biblical quotes (did Tebow really know that his defense was going to betray him this season?  Why else would have a passage related to the Last Supper plastered all over his face on Saturday?), and put up tons of points to bring us into our New Year as happy fans.
- Rose Bowl (Jan 1) - The only game that we are absolutely sure of.  **Ohio State**, the outright winner of the Big Ten, against **Oregon**, the PAC-10 champion.  Is it sad that I'm not really sure what to expect out of this game?  I mean, I haven't seen Ohio State play in a couple of weeks (boo, no championship Big Ten game), so I kinda forget what team this is.  But Oregon... wow.  Another spectacular offensive team, and a defense that's no slouch either.  The most exciting component of this game right now is seeing what uniform Oregon walks out of the tunnels in.  Personally, I'm hoping for those [flat-black helmets that they wore during the Black-Out of Arizona](http://wearetrue.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/oregonuni1.jpg).
- Fiesta Bowl (Jan 4) - Ahh, this is where things get interesting.  ESPN is slating **TCU**, the Mountain West champions, to take one of these slots.  Ok, that makes sense.  But who's a worthy opponent to throw against them?  I'd love to see them play Texas on a neutral field... Skip Bayless mentioned this matchup on ESPN First Take one morning, and as much as I despise the guy, there's no denying that this matchup would be a blast to watch.  But since Texas won their game, we have to include an at-large team in this game.  And what team makes better sense to place here than **Boise State**, the perennial powerhouse of the Western Athletic Conference.  Houston and BYU made their pushes this season, but I don't think there was much doubt that these two teams would be the ones to come out on top.  Since we can't really see TCU get a shot at one of the Big Boys ('Bama, Texas, Florida) this season, why not have them square off for non-BCS Conference Bragging Rights?  Is it really fair to the teams?  Not at all... if this matchup happens, expect a ton of uproar from fans complaining that "the BCS is scared to pit their pretty teams against the non-automatic qualifiers" (and they're exactly right).  But is this going to be an exciting football game?  You better believe it.
- Orange Bowl (Jan 5) - **Georgia Tech**, by virtue of winning the ACC this season, gets an automatic bid into the Orange Bowl this year.  And who will they face?  Our second at-large team of the bowl season, the **Iowa Hawkeyes**.  (Warning: Extreme Bias Incoming)  Let's be honest, people.  Iowa was a good football team this year.  Great?  Nah.  Good?  Definitely.  The "OMG NEAR LOSS" to Northern Iowa was not a fluke.  Northern Iowa was an outstanding team for the first half of the year, absolutely pounding the crap out of every opponent that they played.  Maybe the game shouldn't have been as close as it was, but Iowa showed early in the season that they could strengthen their defense, flex their special teams powers, and get just a little bit lucky exactly when they needed to.  We weren't a pretty team, but we won, and that's what matters.  And except for one play (during the Northwestern game when our starting QB, Ricky Stanzi, went down for the season), there is no denying that Iowa had a legitimate shot at running the tables, locking up the Rose Bowl, and possibly vying for a slot in the national championship game.  They deserve to show up at this game, and give the Georgia Tech's Flexbone Option offense a run for their money.
- National Championship Game (Jan 7) - A near certainty, unless something absolutely incredible happens with the voters, will have **Alabama** playing for their first national championship against **Texas**.  If Texas plays like they did yesterday, they have absolutely no chance of winning.  If they show up... well, they still have no chance.  I'm calling it right now; Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide will roll all over the Longhorns.  Not that this won't be a great game... but Texas can't run the football very well as of late, and the 'Bama defense will eat that O-Line as a snack on their way to the McCoy Feast.

Outstanding games.  I'm excited.  But... since this is my blog, I get to play Devil's Advocate.  Yes, I'm talking about a playoff.  A 4-team playoff doesn't seem like it would be good enough (ooo, let's add 2 more games).  I would love to see an 8-team playoff for the National Championship, and this year would make it so good.  Seriously, look at the potential that we have.

First, all auto-qualifiers make it into these seedings.  Then, you throw in the next 2 highest BCS ranking teams (for the sake of this argument, I'm going to assume that Boise State and Florida are going to be these teams). You rank them top to bottom, seed the teams and let them go at it.

- #1 Alabama (SEC)
- #8 Georgia Tech (ACC)

- #4 TCU (at large)
- #5 Florida (at large)

- #3 Cincinnati (Big East)
- #6 Oregon (PAC-10)

- #2 Texas (Big 12)
- #7 Ohio State (Big 10)

Ho... ly.... $\*^!@$#.  I would happily take Iowa/Boise State in order to watch this playoff.  TCU/Florida would be a dream matchup for any fan of the playoff system.  Cincy/Oregon would be a huge slugfest.  Let's assume that the top seeds win (for this argument)... you'll then have Alabama vs. TCU (another WOW game), and Texas vs. Cincinnati.

Are you as excited as I am right now?

Here's why this would work.  At-large teams that perform well (TCU) would get a legit shot at playing some big-name teams.  In this particular case, after 1 win against the Tebows Gators, they would be playing the #1 team in the nation.  The ultimate test to see if you belong or not.  This also allows teams that perform admirably all season long, only to come up just short of the glory (Florida this season), or that happens to split their conference titles (nearly Pitt/Cincy) a shot at still making it into the playoff.  The entire tournament takes 3 weeks, which is about how long the bowl season is anyway.  You can play the games at the Orange/Rose/Sugar/Fiesta Bowl, then maybe throw in the new Dallas Stadium possibly the new Minnesota Vikings stadium that's being built, before finishing at the National Championship site.  You could easily rotate these locations too, in order to make sure everyone gets a chance to enjoy the glory.

Why are we not doing this yet?
