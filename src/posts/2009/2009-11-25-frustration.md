![](images/Worry.jpg)Let me be frank for just a minute here.

I'm extremely nervous, worried, and frustrated.

I'm back at school, working towards a degree in Management Information Systems.  That, in and of itself, isn't frustrating.  In fact, I love school.  I've been learning new things left and right throughout the year, and (as I've stated previously) for the first time ever, I am actually enjoying school.  It's great.  I'm just getting frustrated as I hear about all my friends with potential interviews, job offers, yadda yadda.  Shawn heads off to Principal in January.  Drew has so many interviews nationwide, I don't even know what he's doing.  And it goes on and on from there.

My whole reasoning for going back to school stemmed from my time at John Deere.  I worked for a subcontractor while I was there, doing IT work and deploying computers out to users throughout the Waterloo plants and offices.  I loved the job, I loved my work... but I hated the management.  I can't come up with enough big words to describe my loathing for how TechTeam (the company I was a part of) was managed (or mismanaged, as I saw it).  My whole thought process when I left that wretched hell-hole was "hey, maybe I can be the one that manages a company like this someday".  Mostly I wanted to be the "good guy", correcting all the crappiness in a job like that and making Company X an organization people enjoyed working for... but I'd be alright with just being a little higher on the "shit flows downhill" food chain and making more than just entry-level money as well.

But now, as I sit here, it's November 25th.  Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.  3 weeks, and I'll be done with this semester.  A month from now, Christmas.  And then spring semester, followed by summer.  (Duh.)  My issue is, I have absolutely \*no\* clue what I'm doing this summer yet.  I need a job, but I'm tired of getting crappy temporary jobs like I've had practically all my life up to this point.  Deere was something that could've potentially turned into a career, had it not been for the tumbling economy (which, in turn, led to my noticing of the garbage management practices).  Otherwise, it's been a plethora of jobs at Northern Iowa, Hy-Vee, GameStop, detasseling, and so on.

I realize that I'm currently sitting with practically no schooling that relates towards my intended career, and my work experience is also limited.  I also have absolutely no clue what to look for when it comes to possible jobs, especially around the Waterloo/Cedar Falls area.  I've had a couple interviews, but one job was volunteer only, and another calls me back tomorrow to let me know (though I've heard that the company is a little shady in multiple ways, so who knows...).  I know that once I graduate and have my degree, that I could find a job somewhere, but unfortunately I'm unable to focus on the "good" things that are down the road, and rather am forced to stay focused on the "hopefully good" things that are on my immediate horizon.  I.  Need.  Money.  I'm sure if push comes to shove, that I can probably find something to do around CF this summer, though whether I'll be able to break that elusive $10/hour barrier is a question yet to be answered.  More than likely, this means that my desire to make it out to Seattle/Washington state is probably going to go down the tube... but I've got my priorities.  Money money money.

It's frustrating, having some of the more expensive hobbies out there.  I love video games, Apple computers (though I really would like to build my own PC from scratch), photography, and guitars.  I have a nasty habit of spending money, whether or not I actually have it (though I have gotten much better about not spending everything).  I desperately need a new computer, since my PowerBook G4 is getting ready to choke on me.  I have a strong desire to redo my entire guitar rig (amp and pedals), which is going to cost a pretty penny.  I would absolutely love to acquire a nice DSLR camera and start doing more photography again.  And Lord knows there are a ton of good video games coming out that I would love to get my hands on (Assassin's Creed 2, MAG, the new Final Fantasy, Gran Turismo 5, and many many more), now that good games are finally coming out for the PS3.  I need some sort of boring, inexpensive hobby, like Yoga or something... blech.

I'm also extremely frustrated and annoyed because it appears as though my tendonitis is spreading.  (Before you say anything, no Mom, I have not picked up my medication yet.)  Starting last weekend, I noticed an extremely nasty pain in my left shoulder.  After my lecture on Tuesday, I decided to visit the doctor, where I learned that it was just a simple case of the tendonitis that has afflicted the right side of my body spreading over to my left shoulder as well.  Thankfully, its not something that really limits a majority of what I do on a day-to-day basis, but it's obnoxious enough that I whine about it occasionally.

Some other random thoughts/notes/blatherings...

\- I wish I could sing better.  Guys that can play guitar are nice... guys that can play guitar and sing get all the ladies.  No, that's not my motivation, it's just an added perk.  Maybe I'll have to take some lessons sometime. - I can't believe 4 days of my break are already gone.  It's kinda sad.  I need to wake up earlier so I can enjoy my days a little more, but at the same time, that means I have to go to bed sooner.  Then I couldn't be productive and write long blog posts.  Decisions, decisions. - I have officially read the first two books of the Twilight series.  Yes, I'm a straight male.  I'm not really sure what I think about them... they're much better than the movies, and I'm looking forward to Justin getting back on Saturday so I can borrow/read the last 2 of the books, but I'm still trying to decide if I really like them or not. - I have officially beaten the entire single player mode of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.  This includes playing through the game on the hardest difficulty level, as well as finding all of the "enemy intel" that are scattered throughout all the levels... that was a pain. - I have yet to touch any of my studies, and figure that I will do that starting on Friday.  I may as well enjoy my break to the fullest, right? - I missed working out on Monday, but I did go today.  Hopefully I'll go tomorrow as well. - My room is not cleaned yet.  Thus, I can't properly write my blog about being organized.  This needs to be remedied soon.  Maybe tomorrow? - I get to go to Tennessee over the Christmas break this year.  I'm really excited about this.  Lots to do there, as well as people to visit. - Really angry with myself that I did not participate in NaNoWriMo this year... or more specifically, really angry that all my ideas have decided to show up now, the week of my vacation.  Rawrgityblargh. - I have nearly 2 months worth of songs, and I continue to acquire more.  And I love it.  Most have been listened to at least once, many of these more.  I don't acquire crappy music, and if I do, it goes in the trash.  If you've got ideas of good music, throw it my way. - I got a new phone.  I finally got tired of my Rumor freezing up on me, so I strong-armed Sprint into giving me a Rumor2 for free.  Not sure what I think of this phone yet... it does some really dumb things at really weird times.  They obviously need better programmers.
