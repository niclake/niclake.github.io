First off... for your viewing pleasure... Brett Favre, ladies and gentlemen.

Gotta love a guy who's able to make fun of himself like that.  Can't wait for this season to start.

I'm sitting here in the CBB computer lab (where I work), and there's about 15-20 students in here working on papers or projects or whatnot.  There's also 2 guys from the security department attempting to change the alarm code.  Needless to say, they're failing at it miserably, and the panel keeps beeping extremely loud, making everyone in the room mildly annoyed.  I'm kinda pissed, cause it makes me look bad, even though I have absolutely nothing to do with it.  Laaaaaaaaaame!

What age was it for you, when you first knew exactly what it was that you were going to do?  I felt so certain when I was 18 that I was going to be a music teacher the rest of my life... 4 years later, here I am, a business student with at least 3 years to go, wondering if maybe I'll be going to grad school, not even knowing what kind of job market there is for my major.  4 years from now, I'll probably have a whole new game plan, still not have any clue what's going on in life... blah.  I guess it's better than being roped into something that you find out later you just weren't cut out for, right?  I've had all too many of those experiences...

I'm thinking of taking a trip to Seattle this summer.  Not sure why, how I'm going to get there, when I'm going, how long I'll stay, etc... but I really just need to get out of this state for a little while.  I've been north (Boundary Waters and Glacier National Park), south (Mexico), and east (Florida... i wanna go to Boston sometime as well), whereas my stint out west was extremely brief and didn't allow me to see much, and Seattle has been a place that's always interested me... so if you want to go, let me know.  I'm looking to make the trip w/ a couple people.
