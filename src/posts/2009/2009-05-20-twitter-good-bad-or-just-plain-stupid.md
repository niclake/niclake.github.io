I really don't know what to think about Twitter some days.

![](images/twitter_logo.jpg)I got Twitter over a year ago (you're welcome to [follow me](http://www.twitter.com/niclake13), if you'd like), used it once or twice, and stopped using it.  Essentially, it's just Facebook status updates, without the rest of Facebook.  Not really something I was interested in at the time.

Suddenly, just in the past few months, Twitter has exploded for absolutely no reason whatsoever.  Some celebrity got ahold of it, then told their friends.  Then some magazine or writer or someone mentioned it, and everyone who's ever adored Johnny Depp or Paris Hilton just \*had\* to have it.

To be fair, Twitter has a very very ideal use... media.  Think about it.  Say Joe Schmo is out working on an exclusive cover story for the local news, but wants to give his viewers a reason to watch.  Post it on a blog?  Put a big article on the news page?  Why not Tweet it?  Give us a small taste of what's coming up, and get us all to tune in.  Or, in my case... as a sports fan, I can stay on the up-to-the-minute with all the sports trades, injuries, highlights, and things of that nature, which in turn allows me to blog about things faster.  Time is money.

Twitter is called a "micro-blogging service"... in some ways, it's almost like a micro-stalking circus.

I'll give Twitter this much... instant gratification, a way to keep track of your friends/co-workers/people of interest, and so flexible that it's got almost limitless possibility in the future.  I remember annoying the hell out of some people when I "tweeted" scored updates from every hole of an 18-hole golf game with my friend.

Do I use it?  Absolutely.  Will I continue to use it?  Definitely... it's a very handy way for me to keep up-to-date on a lot of things.  Do I scratch my head in wonder about why/how it got so popular so quickly?  I think I'm going bald, to be honest.
