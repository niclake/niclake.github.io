I'm fed up with stupid people in sports.  Truly, I am.  I'm sure this is a post that will get revisited over and over again throughout the years, but tonight I just need to hash it out with some of the biggest names in sports (or maybe not big names, but the stupid ones).

I told you that this would be sometimes cynical.

**Barry Bonds\*** - No one has any "proof" that you used steroids or PEDs, but over the course of your career, you developed from a well-built man that liked to run, into a beast, a freak, who's knees have absolutely no ability to support your body weight any longer.  Somehow through it all, you managed to get ahold of a trainer that liked you enough to keep his mouth shut.  But this hurts you.  See, if you were innocent, if the evidence against you is wrong, then why doesn't he testify and tell people such?  Instead, he'll chill in a jail cell while you're in court.  You'll more than likely never play baseball again.  Your attitude and the dark clouds surrounding you are probably going to prevent you, Mr. Home Run King(\*), from ever getting into the Hall of Fame.

If all these allegations about you are false, then you need to step forward with your proof and say as such.  In short, you need to think with your dipstick, Jimmay.

**![](images/alex-rodriguez-picture-1.jpg)Alex Rodriguez** - Have you no common sense?  Seriously?  You live in New York.  You play for the Yankees.  You're under a ton of scrutiny for your steroid transgressions.  Obviously you've lied to everyone in the past, saying "No, Katie, I never used steroids".  Sure, you were young and dumb, but now you claim to have grown up and gotten wiser.  Really?  Then what possibly motivated you to leave the spring training ballpark in the same vehicle as your cousin, the same cousin who allegedly was the one injecting you with steroids?  I mean, you were the one that told us who it was doing the dirty work for you.

Since you're obviously incapable, Alex, I would suggest going out and hiring your own personal advisor, someone who can supply you with a dipstick to do some thinking with.  That, or just cuddle up next to Madonna for a while.  Maybe she can keep you out of trouble (then again, she got you in a whole bundle of trouble already, didn't she?).

**![](images/t1_selig.jpg)Bud Selig** - You, sir, have turned the game of baseball that I hold so near and dear into a media circus.  When I tune into ESPN, I like to see things on the ticker about scores, trades, and things like that.  Not things about steroids, or lists of players cheating that are still sitting in limbo.

You have sat on the steroid issue  for years.  Even before the Great Home Run Race, you \*knew\* about the existence of steroids, and you just hoped that no one else would pick up on it.  Then, when some players got nailed with a positive test, you just swept things under the rug, pretending that nothing is wrong.

Now that there's obviously no stopping the vampiric blood-sucking vultures media in their endless pursuit of a story, you take a "strong stance" against steroids, trying to nail A-Rod for past transgressions that have absolutely nothing to do with where he is today (except maybe his paycheck, but that's not your issue).  And even then, you're not releasing the list of the other 103 players that tested positive during the same set of tests.  Huh?   I'm really curious to see what you're going to propose when the CBA expires in 2010.  Your current testing policy is ludicrous, and does absolutely nothing  in terms of prevention.

You need to take a 0-tolerance policy against this, Mr. Selig.  1-and-done.  If you test positive for a PED at any point, no matter who it is, you are gone.  Test the players every month, every two weeks, whatever you need to do.  Take a stand together with the NFL and NBA (even the NHL, if you want to go that far) and try to create one universal testing agency to cover all sports.  This way, we won't have to worry about skewed tests from multiple groups, and you could redeem yourself by being the "Crusher of the Steroids Era".

I don't even have a pithy quip for you on this one.  Start thinking with your dipstick, Bud.

**Basketball Referees** - There's this violation called traveling.  I'm with Bob Knight on this one.  Call it more.  Jimmay.

**![](images/16beck.jpg)L.A. Galaxy** - David Beckham obviously doesn't want to be in America anymore.  And when you play for AC Milan, I don't blame you.  Hey, this means you don't have to pay him anymore, so that should be a relief.

And along these lines... **Americans**.  You love hockey.  You love golf.  For the love of Pete, you enjoy NASCAR.  How can you possibly not find joy in watching soccer?  Women have posters of Beckham plastered everywhere, but the minute he puts a shirt on and runs around on a pitch, their interest is suddenly quashed.

Around where I live, we have a 20+ field soccer complex.  During the summer, that place is \*packed\* with kids and their parents, from age 4 to 18, all playing and loving the game.  Yet somewhere along the way, the desire to pay attention to the MLS is crushed.

To be honest, the highlight of many of my weeks (kinda sad, I know) is to see a good UEFA Cup match on ESPN2 (2:30 EST, usually).  AC Milan, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool... sure, I don't follow the sport with a passion, nor do I know any players other than the superstars who's names I hear every week.  For whatever reason, though, soccer just captivates me.  It's like chess on a huge field of grass.  And points are usually only scored when something absolutely majestic happens (or goofy looking... someone for Chelsea totally kicked a ball kung-fu style and completely froze the defense).  Sure, it's a little boring... but so are all the sports I mentioned above.  What's not to like about it?

 

Any suggestions for future Dipstick awards?
