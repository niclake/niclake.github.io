This is why I hate fantasy football.

Apparently, the stats aren't "official" for a day or two afterwards.  Also apparently, the Saints did something to warrant them losing 1 point in the score column.  More than likely, they didn't get as many return yards as originally thought.  Long story short... instead of a 1 point victory, I tied.

/facepalm
