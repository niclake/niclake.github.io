I have friends that watch sports.  I have friends that play video games.  I have friends that are geeks like me.  Male, female, straight, gay, short, tall, I have friends that fit almost every category.

Except I don't have many musical friends.  More specifically, I don't have many friends who play guitar/bass/drums, and consider that to be "their thing".

This saddens me.
