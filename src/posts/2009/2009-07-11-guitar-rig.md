I take back anything I'd previously written in regards to my future guitar rig... and I'll probably take this back someday as well. But that's ok.

After some research, trials, and thinking, I \*think\* I've narrowed down what it is that I'd like to get for my new guitar rig (or revamped rig, I guess). I remember looking at rack-mounted effects, at huge amps (like the Mesa Road King... that amp is still amazing), or beefy guitars like Les Pauls and more Paul Reed Smiths... and then I got a little older and a bit wiser.

So... without further ado... my rig (including an \*x\* if I already own it):

Effects chain: - Tuner: \*x\* BOSS TU-2 Tuner (running from Tuner Out of volume pedal) - Fuzz: Electro Harmonix Big Muff - Wah: Dunlop 95Q Crybaby Wah - Compression: BOSS CS-2 Compression (gotta find a good one on eBay) - Overdrive: Ibanez TS808 Overdrive or Fulltone Fulldrive2 MOSFET Overdrive/Clean Boost (Fulltone would eliminate need for BOSS GE-7 EQ as well) - Distortion: BOSS BD-2 Blues Driver, ZVex Vexter Box of Rock, or Visual Sound V2JH Jekyll & Hyde (probably 2 of these) - Suppression: BOSS NS-2 Noise Suppressor (maybe... I may not need it) - EQ: BOSS GE-7 Equalizer (as a boost and lead pedal... maybe) - EQ: BBE Sonic Stomp (any guitar player \*not\* playing metal should get this pedal) - Phaser: MXR Phase 90 Phaser (I own a BOSS PH-2 Phaser, and would like to replace it) - Chorus: \*x\* BOSS CS-1 Chorus (couple alternatives in mind, but I own this, so it works) - Volume: Ernie Ball Volume Pedal - Delay: \*x\* BOSS DD-20 Delay - Reverb: BOSS RV-5 Reverb or TC Electronic ND-1 Nova Delay (just heard the Nova tonight, and I love it... have to play w/ it a bit at Guitar Center)

Those pedals alone are going to run me right around $2,000, and that's taking into account the 3 I already own. Ouch. Other possible effects that might make their way onto my board are: \*x\* BOSS TR-2 Tremelo, Digitech Whammy ($200), Pro Co RAT ($95), and a flanger (if I can find one that sounds good to my ears... not a fan of the one I have now).

Amplifier: - Fender Hot Rod Deluxe. Classic, great sounding, and gets the job done. ($700) - (someday) An additional amplifier that takes care of all the distortion options (Diezel VH4, Splawn Nitro, Mesa Triple Rectifier, or something of the sort)

Guitars: - \*x\* Fender American Standard Stratocaster (circa 2000) - My first guitar. Possibly replacing the pickups in this at some point, but they're growing on me, so who knows. - Fender American Vintage '52 Telecaster - Really really would like one of these. Only alternative would be to get a true vintage guitar, rather than a reissue. ($1,800) - \*x\* Paul Reed Smith (PRS) Custom 24 - Another of my current guitars. Slowly tweaking, finally getting the muddiness worked out of it. - Maybe some form of hollowbody guitar; options include Gretsch G6136T White Falcon ($3100), Gibson ES-335 ($3,300), or possibly a Fender '69 Thinline Telecaster ($900)

\- \*x\* Mogami Instrument Cables (if you're a guitar player, do yourself a favor and acquire some of these... you'll thank yourself) - George L's effects patch cables

This is definitely going to be one of those "project" things, something that I work on for the course of 5-10 years. Who knows, maybe I'll get lucky and win the lottery... wait, you probably have to play to win, don't you? Crap.

I give this a month max before this changes... but really, everything pretty much revolves around this list. I was right... this only took about 2 weeks before this changed.Â  Nothing major, just some little tweaks here and there.

Oh, and I'll need to build a new board too... pretty sure my current one won't fit everything.

\*\*\*I am accepting any/all donations in order to get this project completed ASAP. Thanks. :-) \*\*\*
