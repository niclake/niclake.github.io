I don't believe a lot of things.  That's just how I roll.  Whether it's from life experience or lack thereof, from my own opinions, whatever.  I think or believe some things, but obviously I don't believe many others.

![](images/05-fabio021006_big1.jpg)\- I can't believe I was alive to witness some of the greatest sporting events ever.  Some that come to mind... Ripkin's record setting start.  Jordan's everything.  Tiger Woods.  A perfect NFL regular season.  The Syracuse/UConn 6OT thriller last spring.  A Red Sox World Series victory (not once, but twice!).  And I'm only 22.  I (hopefully) have years and years to go.  It's hard to fathom what I've already witnessed, and what I may see here in the future.

\- I don't believe everyone gets a second chance.  America is the Land of Opportunity, but it's also the Land of Hard Work, Perseverance, and Luck.

\- I don't believe women are evil.  I may outwardly express this sentiment occasionally, but I don't believe it.

\- I can't believe how dumb women can be sometimes.  I'm sure women feel the same way about men sometimes too, but for now, I'm being selfish and just talking about me.  (I'm almost done writing the post, but I just had to get this quote in here somehow... from I, Robot... "Mother damn, she just shot at you with her eyes closed!"  "HEY!  Did you just shoot at me with your eyes closed?!?"  "Well, it worked didn't it???")

\- I \*DO\* believe "Once a cheater, always a cheater."

\- I can't believe I've been single for a year and a half.  Long time...

\- I can't believe it's been nearly 8 months since my dog died.  I am not looking forward to spending time at home over Thanksgiving.  I have a nasty habit for letting things get too close to my heart and my true emotions, and when they disappear I get crushed pretty easily.  I'm still waiting to hear barking when I walk in my front door, and I can't wander into my kitchen without looking to where my pooch's dog basket used to sit.

\- I can't believe that I used to be suicidal.  I'm glad I was smart about things in high school and actually opened up to the right people.  I just read a couple of stories that I wrote during my senior year when I was struggling with things that brought back a lot of memories, which is actually why I wrote this post in the first place.

\- I don't believe life should be easy for anyone.  Experiences are what makes you who you are.  Getting handed the keys to life cheapens what time we have here on Earth.

\- I can't believe it's almost Thanksgiving break.  Starting week 13 of this semester.  Holy wow, where did all those days go?

\- I refuse to believe that I just added a picture to my blog that had Fabio in it.  I will choose to believe that the picture includes an extremely ugly woman.

\- I can't believe that the Colts beat the Patriots tonight.  I picked them to win in our pick'em this week, but the mistakes made by the Pats today were just foolish.

\- I don't believe I'm cut out to teach.  This is part of why I got out of the music education program (the other part being my surgery).  I've though about getting a business teaching major/minor, but I really don't think I'd be happy enough with it to make it worth my while.

\- I don't believe in fate.  I believe that while everyone on Earth has a purpose and a mission to their life, every human being has their own decisions to make in order to get them from point A to point B.  Some of us (raises hand) take some very roundabout paths at getting there, and still have no clue what exactly point B entails.  Others figure out what they want to do very early on, put their foot down, get there, and have the remainder of their life to reap the benefits of what they have done.

\- I don't believe that human beings are "good" by nature.  I've seen way too much shit go down in life to believe this anymore.  Human beings are nasty, cutthroat, greedy, selfish bastards.  Many people only do "good" things because it's the proper thing to do in our society.  There are some "good" people in this world, and most of the time I would consider myself in this category.  Sometimes, though, I can be a downright nasty person myself, and it's not necessarily something that I'm totally thrilled about.

\- I can't believe I've been up till 1:30 every night this past week.

\- I can't believe how many current Iowa Hawkeyes are in the NFL.  To name a handful that I remember watching play for the Hawks... Jonathan Babineaux, Ladell Betts, Scott Chandler, Dallas Clark, Colin Cole, Sean Considine, Jared DeVries, Robert Gallery, Charles Godfrey, Chad Greenway, Abdul Hodge, Mike Humpal, Ken Iwebema, CJ Jones, Nate Kaeding, Aaron Kampman, Marcus Paschal, Derrick Robinson, Matt Roth, and Bob Sanders.  Yikes.

\- I can't believe that my alcoholic drink of choice is Southern Comfort on the rocks.  Definitely wouldn't have pegged myself on that when I started drinking.

\- Along the same lines... I refuse to believe I'm such a lightweight.  I drank a bit on Saturday for the first time in nearly 2 months, and was pretty much gone after 1.5 drinks.

\- I refuse to believe that my opportunity to be a professional musician has passed me by.  I'm slowly giving up hope, but I keep my eyes and ears open and keep praying that I'll get my shot.

\- I can't believe that I can't play the piano anymore.  I'm going to go hunt around my house sometime in the next few weeks to find some music to play.  I haven't played with any sort of structure since my junior year of high school playing with the Jazz Band, since I'd quit taking lessons my sophomore year.

\- I can't believe that Creed is back.  On a related note, I refuse to believe that their music is good... though I'll probably get their CD and add it to my secret stash of music I pretend I don't/didn't listen to.  Hanson, the Spice Girls, older Creed, and the Backstreet Boys are part of this list.  Britney Spears was hot, so I don't care.

I refuse to tag everything in this post.  It's almost 1:45, and I don't care that much.  Therefore, I'm tagging my basic categories and calling it good.
