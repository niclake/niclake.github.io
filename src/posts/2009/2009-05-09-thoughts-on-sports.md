**Baseball:** A-Rod hit a home run on the very first pitch he saw this season... He \*must\* be juicing.  Must've forgotten to take his **[Woman's Fertility Drug](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/gut-wrenching/)** though... cause he struck out in his next two at bats.

The Red Sox are a resilient bunch.  Crawford ran nuts on us (again)... actually, on Penny... but Bay and Drew have been absolutely lighting things up lately (with Pedroia acting as no slouch either).  Early, maybe.  Promising?  Definitely.

As much as I hate the Yankees, it was nice to see C.C. Sa-fat-ia return to old form.  Complete game, 1 walk, 0 runs, 8(??) strikeouts.  Here's my tipping of the cap to you, sir... now go lose every game the rest of the season.

**Basketball: The amount of hard fouls in the NBA right now is just a bit much.  Thankfully, there wasn't anything too much tonight (and as I write that, I watch Kendrick Perkins stick his elbow in someone's jugular)... Artest has a real bad air about him stemming from the Detroit alcohol abuse (see: beer-chucking) incident.  I still think to this day that Artest was more angry about the guy wasting a good beer than he was getting hit with it.**

I think I called this already... but the Celtics are looking as though they are done.  It's too bad... they wore themselves out beating the Bulls in an epic series (best ever in the NBA, in my opinion), and they truly don't match up well with the Magic.  It's lining up nicely for LeBron vs. Kobe, and that will be a fantastic series if it comes to that.

**Drugs: I am still advocating a professional sport-wide testing system for drugs and performance-enhancers.  One large organization.  If some sports allow for things that others don't fine... they'll show up on the test, but it won't matter.  We \*need\* stability, we \*need\* to take a stand as fans to keep our sports pure.  (Basically, the NBA and NFL need to team up, then pummel Bud Selig into submission until he gives in.)**
