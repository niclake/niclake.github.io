As this summer winds to a close, I realize that I have, in fact, had it pretty decent.  There have been the obvious downs (dumb roommates, jobs downsizing, money crunches), but there have been tons of ups as well.

School starts in 6 days.  Work starts in 7.  I can't even begin to explain how excited I am.  I pulled a B and a B- from my summer classes, and now I'm ready to go full swing into this new semester.  Sucky part is, this is Shawn's last semester, and the beginning of Jordan's last year... so that kinda sucks.  (Oh, and Curt has 2 years to go...)  But at the same time, I'll be back in the dorms (\*vomit\*) so I'll have an opportunity to meet people and whatnot.

Today... Golfing 9 holes w/ Shawn, then video games all afternoon and evening.  I figure I'll get it all out of my system before school starts.  Maybe.  :-P

I really hate my golf game.  I can't drive, and I can't putt.  My best shot of the day was a 200-yd 5 wood from the rough that somehow made its way within 10 feet of the green.  I then proceeded to miss that birdie putt. :-(  All my drives sliced extremely far right, or were topped to the left.  No in between.  It's a common theme, and I still don't know how to fix it.  I actually started hitting some really good putts on the last 3 holes, playing the breaks extremely well.  I just need to work on touch now.  Shawn drilled a 30 ft putt on a hole that put me to shame, which I think in turn motivated me to fix my putting (somehow).  My short game?  Questionable.  Lots of good shots, lots of extremely shady shots too.  Ugh.

Alright... I'm a huge Vikings fan, and I'm a moderator of a Vikings forum on Yahoo!, so I figure maybe I should weigh in on this Brett Favre crap.  I was getting really sick of all the "should I play, shouldn't I play" stuff that he was throwing out, and more than anything, I'm glad that there's a decision finally in the books.  I was getting really annoyed with all the indecision crap.  All that being said... considering all of our QBs that we had on our team, I feel that we have made an upgrade.  Think about it... We have Adrian Peterson in the backfield, Berrian and Percy Harvin playing the receiver positions (including Harvin as the Wildcat guy), we have an ok TE in Shiancoe... the only offensive key we were missing was a NFL-caliber QB.  TJack was not a NFL QB, and I don't know if he ever will be, though I still feel he'll have a place in gimicky formations or a different system.  John David Booty hadn't taken any NFL snaps yet, so he's obviously not ready.  Sage Rosenfels was supposed to be the new head of the team, but the coaching staff seems to have a real soft spot for a QB that runs around and jumps before throwing an errant pass (\*coughTJackcough\*).  Now, we have an older but very NFL caliber QB, who knows the system, knows how to make playoff pushes, and knows how to lead a team at the helm.  I feel that we are now ready to make a solid playoff run now, and maybe even add something silver and shiny to our trophy case.

Time to go watch the Cubs play.  Peace.
