Wow, it has been a really long time since I've posted in this blog... I should start doing it more.

Life... ok, what's up.  I'm looking for a new job currently to get me through the summer.  My full-time position with TechTeam got moved to part-time, which is practically no-time.  Ugh.  But why just till the summer, you ask?  Easy...

Because this fall, I'm heading back to UNI to pursue a degree in Management Information Systems (i.e. Business + computers) and a minor (probably) in Journalism.  I feel it's high time that I go back, get an education, and allow myself to get a good job in the working world.  My grandparents have thankfully helped me out in getting UNI paid off for old bills that I owed them, and I'm extremely grateful for that.  It's gonna suck though, going back and having maybe a semester/year with most of my friends before they all graduate (if they haven't already)... including those younger than me.  Ugh.

I also spent part of this evening researching and figuring out my "new guitar rig" (quoted because there's no way I can afford the $6,000 that it's going to end off costing me anytime soon).  I'm a pedal whore, relying on a combination of playing ability and sonic modulation to produce my happy sound... so that's where a lot of the money goes to.  But I'm also looking at acquiring a [Fender Vintage '52 Telecaster](http://www.fender.com/products//search.php?partno=0100202850) and a [Fender Hot Rod Deluxe amplifier](http://fender.com/products/search.php?partno=0213202000).  I also dabble a bit with various programs on my Mac, and put together a pretty little graphic of what my pedal layout would be (for those that are interested)...

The good news is that I've already got 6 of those pedals.  The bad news is that there's still 12 more to buy...

It's funny that most of my life revolves around sports... when I get the urge to write on something, it's [always over on my other blog.](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com)  I'm hoping that once I get back into having somewhat more of a "real life" that maybe this will pick up.

OH!  Music.  Holy crap.  I've had a band called Bloc Party on my computer for about... oh, I don't know, maybe a year or so.  I busted them out when I was filling out job applications... dang, they are a sweet band.  British Indie Rock, I believe is how they choose to classify themselves.  [This is currently](http://www.imeem.com/blocparty/music/D14fC7LO/bloc-party-better-than-heaven/) my favorite song of theirs.

Also, for those that missed me saying something about it last week... Irony: A Red Cross Disaster Relief truck getting into a car accident. (This was followed by a reply... Irony: Getting hit by a Dodge truck.)

It's definitely 3:30am.  I've been up late these last few nights, and I have a job interview tomorrow morning.  I think it's high time I sleep.
