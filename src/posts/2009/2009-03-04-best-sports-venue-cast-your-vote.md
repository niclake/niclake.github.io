![](images/marqee-welcome-to-wrigley-field.jpg)With college basketball putting the pedal to the medal, lots of football combine talk, and the MLB season getting ready to gear up, it got me thinking... what's the best venue in sports?

There's many different places that I can think of. 

- Wrigley Field
- Fenway Park (both of these have tons of history behind them)
- Minute Maid Park (you gotta love that hill in center field, or the train going above left)
- Cameron Indoor Stadium (Dominating home court advantage, complete with crazy fans... yes you, Speedo Guy)
- McAfee Colosseum (Yeah, the Raiders suck... but they've got wicked crazy fans)
- Lambeau Field (Wanna play here in December?  Didn't think so)

As a huge baseball fan, I'm not going to be happy until I visit both Wrigley and Fenway.  I was gonna hit up Wrigley here a few weeks ago and do a winter tour, but plans got changed... I was not a happy camper.  And if the Cubs and Red Sox ever played a World Series against each other... I just might have to sell my soul to go watch every game in those ballparks.

What about you?  What's your favorite place to visit, or watch on TV, or (if you were lucky enough to be a big-time star) play at?
