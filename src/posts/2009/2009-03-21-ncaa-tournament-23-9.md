> There are a few games that I’m a bit worried in… Florida State/Wisconsin, Arizona State/Temple, and Utah/Arizona (seriously… AZ squeaked in.  Why is everyone picking them?).

Well, that's why I was worried.  Wisconsin and Arizona pulled out wins from... well, somewhere, making Northern Iowa the only 12 seed not to win this year.  Also, we are gauranteed to have at least 1 12 or 13 seed in the Sweet Sixteen this year (a matchup between Cleveland State and Arizona on Sunday will determine that).

Wake Forest... I don't even want to talk about it.  You had the #1 ranking earlier in the season, and you absolutely choked.  I'm extremely disappointed.  There goes one of my Final Four picks, meaning that Louisville will probably make it in and wreck havoc on Memphis.

Tomorrow's worries: Now that Purdue has advanced, I'm worried that Washington might take a spill.  And Nova will get a test from UCLA... otherwise, I think I got this covered.
