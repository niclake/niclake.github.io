Pre-All Star break: A malfunction in McGrady.  Programming staff complaining of issues stemming from 12-year-old hardware; source of hardware appears to be Canada, which may explain issues with warm Texas climate.

Western Conference Playoffs, Round 1: Catastrophic failure in Center v1.0.Mutombo.  18-year-long project finally put on the shelf.  Rumors of Center v2.0.Thabeet abundant, but unconfirmed.

Round 2: Issues with the mobility phase of the iYao.  Likely out until Phoenix Suns trainers break/fix staff can be lured to more Southern climates.  Shaq's uneaten Krispy Kreme doughnuts rumored to be offered as bait.

With 3 key players out of the lineup, I'd like to introduce you to a new product that will be introduced at the start of game 4:

![](images/ron-artest.2.jpg)BrickAttack, Rocket Edition!, v2 - BrickAttack is a free, open-source game from developer Balls of Fury that all NBA fans can enjoy.  It's one of those games that you actually \*want\* the edition of your most hated team/opponent.  I've already seen over 2 million downloads from the general southern California area (strangely enough, about 500,000 have come from Jack Nicholson's IP address).  BrickAttack, Rocket Edition! is essentially a timer.  You set it at the start of every Houston possession, with your guessed time being how long it will take for Ron Artest to jack up a Brick from some illogical placement on the court.

Version 1 had some issues, due to the fact that there were a large amount of variables I had to take into account (score, time remaining, other stars on the court, etc.).  However, now that 3 key variables have been removed over the last few months, we have removed these variables and released Version 2.  The only variable now is whether Artest is on the court or not.

Other editions are also available... Piston (formerly known as Nugget and Sixer Edition) and Heat editions are available now, while recent changes to the NBA Code have forced us to move Laker, Celtic, and Cavalier editions back into testing.  For added fun, try the Bobcat Edition, in which you try and guess if the team will score 100 points in a game or not (issues with "Hell No" button breaking after 7 presses in 8 games solved).

Order today, and we'll also include our "Old Man Waffling" iPhone app.  It's a simple application to keep you up to date on whether Brett Favre is returning to the NFL this season.  (Essentially, it's just a coin-flip application with pretty graphics, but it has its purpose.)

Stay tuned to this blog... more excellent software is slated for release from Balls of Fury within the next year.  Currently in beta testing: Juiced!, a dart-like game in which you hurl steroid syringes at your favorite MLB athletes.  (Family-friendly Don't-Make-The-Purists-Cry Mode, in which all athlete's faces will be replaced with that of Bud Selig, will be included.)
