Dear Jerry Jones,

You are not bigger than football.  Believe it or not, you are not the face of the Dallas Cowboys.  Please don't issue a gag order on all of your employees.  Without Wade Phillips, Tony Romo, or TO giving us their quips and insight this entire offseason, how on earth are we supposed to keep our interest in NFL football up until August?

I understand the general interest in not having people underneath you talk to the media; Bill Belichick doesn't allow his assistants to speak to the media.  I believe Pete Carroll does the same thing.  I'm sure plenty of other coaches do this with their staff, and possibly some of their players.

But see, there's an important key factor involved here... these guys (Bill and Pete are my examples here) are involved in the day-to-day operations and communication with the members of your organization the media really cares about, those members being the players.  You, Mr. Jones, sit in your plush office and count your extravagant amounts of money, plotting which misfit or unknown player to bring into your system next.  (Please, don't even think about trading for Michael Vick's rights.  Converting big rocks to small rocks and small rocks to gravel while in prison is really not conducive to throwing a football against some of the most physical defenses ever to play the sport of football.  Wait, what's this?  Oh, my bad.  Vick couldn't throw to begin with.)  You \*don't\* speak with all the players daily.  You \*don't\* know what's going on inside the locker room, not really.

Like Mark Cuban, I admire that you are an owner that likes to be seen as a key member of your franchise.  I enjoy hearing some comments come straight from the owners.  But don't kid yourself; I want to hear exactly what TO thought about that lack of a pass interference call in the end zone at the end of the game, not some politically correct answer from the owner of the team that had no part in the actual game.  Your comments make us yawn.  Your player's comments give people like me things to write about.

Regards, -Nic

P.S. Since everyone else is hosting something in your new stadium (NBA All-Star game, concerts, the 2010 Superbowl \[I believe\]), I'd like to propose a few new ideas for you; a NASCAR event (1/4 mile hot laps!), ballerina lessons on the 50 yard line, and my 23rd birthday party next February. I'll let Romo do my guest list.
