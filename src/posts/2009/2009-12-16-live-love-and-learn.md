![](images/thinkingcapwhoa.gif)Before I begin... I have determined the biggest downfall to switching from 5 years of laptop use over to a desktop.  In order to get these random thoughts out of my head, I actually have to get my ass out of bed now.  I'm also sitting here wearing sunglasses with the screen brightness turned extremely low, trying to get my eyes adjusted to the light.

I was attempting to fall asleep, trying to clear my head of stress and worry, when I realized something.  Tomorrow is my last day of the semester.  Physics at 1, Personal Wellness at 5, and I am done. D-o-n-e done.  Maybe not completely done, like a couple of my friends are this semester, but I've done it.  16 weeks and a holiday break later, I have successfully made the transition back to college.  And I'm pretty proud of myself too.  I have one near-surefire A (unless I totally bombed the final, which I highly doubt), one B+/B borderline (and I'm pretty sure I dominated that final), and 3 more pretty solid Bs (though doing well on my tests tomorrow could improve those as well).  I didn't expect to come back in and ace every class.  That's not my style.  Obviously my parents would've loved that... hell, I would've loved that... but I had to be realistic.  For a guy who's never studied, made it through high school opening a book to study as infrequently as possible... yeah, I'm very pleased with myself.  Next semester, I'd like to improve on this.  More B+'s and As.  One step at a time.

You've probably heard me rant before about how jealous I am of some of my above-mentioned friends.  I have one friend that is officially done, save his presentation on Friday.  A couple of friends complete their schooling after this coming spring semester, and another student teaches next fall before wrapping up his time here at UNI.  And the list goes on and on.  Really, I'm happy for them, I truly am.  I've discovered I'm not so much jealous that they're going to be done.  Instead, I'm more mad at myself for just now getting myself into gear.

I look back at the beginning of my junior year, the make-or-break year (in my eyes) of when I should've started to focus.  And in fact, that was probably my worst time ever.  Untreated depression combined with a supreme sense of superiority (stemming from my tenure as a percussionist) led me to not practice for All-State tryouts, expecting that I would get it because I was just that badass.  Yeah... that didn't work too well.  The depression was kinda flaky too.  Junior year was about the time that my arm really started acting up for the first time, leading me to quit piano (though I definitely rejoiced about that for a while).  16.5 years of being single while everyone else around me started/continued dating was also frustrating.  Frankly, school was really the last thing in the world that I cared about.

Senior year had the same results, but for an entirely different reason.  I'd gotten my mental problems worked out, and had started dating my first girlfriend back in May.  I pretty much lived for her.  (No offense, if you're reading this, but) To be honest, that was probably the worst time ever for me to fall in love, since everything that I did for that entire school year seemed to revolve around her.  I remember how much I slacked off that year... Graphic Design, Choir (for the trip, of course), Creative Writing, Band, release, release, AP Psychology.  I miraculously pulled off a 4 on that AP exam, though to this day I'm still not certain how I did that.  I wouldn't give that year up for anything, but I sure would love to have gone back and adjusted my schedule a bit.  Maybe thrown in a few more AP classes, learned to study a bit... yeah.

I won't bore you with details, but college was like that too.  Girlfriend.  Having fun.  Marching band (which was fun).  Video games and computers.  Movies.  Spending money.  Maxing out my credit card.  I thought it was just a grown up version of high school.  Never practiced for my music major, and I'm certain my instructor knew it.  I thought I'd found my calling when I switched to being a computer science major, but then I had a teacher ruin all motivation I had, and it pretty much tanked from there.

Then came the kick in the pants.  Arm surgery.  Finding out the girlfriend had cheated on me for over a year of our 21 month relationship.  (For the record \[be surprised, Mom and Dad\], I was a few short months away from proposing, which made it that much worse.)  Being sick.  Bad grades.  No more credit card.  Every sort of support system that I had built up around myself seemed to crumble beneath me.  Severe depression took over, soon to be followed by reckless and extremely stupid behavior.  Gave myself a nice concussion by tripping over my shoes and hitting my head on my desk.  I ended off flunking out of college that semester.  Went to Hawkeye the following semester, but since I got in so late, the whole financial aid crap didn't go through.  Long story short, it's now like my entire semester there never existed.  (That's alright, I learned more taking the classes this semester anyway.)

Wow, I'm really not sure how this got so long-winded.  Not what I meant to talk about at all, or at least not in this much detail.

Basically... if there's anything that I've learned over the past 6.5 years, it's these:

- Don't take anything for granted.
- My full time job is to be a student.
- I am one of the most stubborn people that I know.  Perhaps the most stubborn.
- I am also one of the most selfish people I know.  It's alright to be selfish in terms of doing things for yourself to help you succeed in life/school/whatever, but it's not alright to do it if you're just being a jerk.
- I'm sure as hell glad that I'm not married/engaged.  I definitely had my focus on the wrong things back then.  Maybe I still do, I don't know.
- My parents, Q, Mike J., Jordan, Mandy, Drew, my cousins and family, Doug, and all my other friends that have been there for me are awesome.  I would not have made it this far without important contributions from you all.
- I love too easily.  That's just how I roll.
- Unfortunately, that gets me burned a lot.
- Life has the sickest and most twisted sense of humor that I have ever run across.  It just so happens to be right up my alley.  Once we stopped fighting over dumb stuff, Life and I started getting along great.
- Simple is always better.  Always.
- Ego is good.  Arrogance is not.
- Live, Love and Learn.  Most important things right there.
- Thinking up blog titles is an art form.

All I have to say is... I'm glad my finals don't start till 1 (though work starts at 10am)... and bring on next semester.  Only 2.5 more years to go.
