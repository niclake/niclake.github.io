Peeling after a sunburn doesn't hurt, but it sure is annoying.

I have determined that I want to acquire a Fender Telecaster.  I have half a mind to sell one of my guitars to do so, but I don't think I can really do that.

I'm going on a Mexican food diet.  You eat it, gain sustenance, and then it works its way through you in about an hour and a half.

I love prime, mid-season baseball.  Nothing better.

The Minnesota Timberwolves (or Timberfools as they should be called) drafted 4 point guards out of their 6 picks in the draft.  3 of them were their first 3 picks.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.

I need to either purchase an external HD or build a server.  Whichever... I just need storage space.

If my Sociology class ended today, I'd have a high B.  For my first class in almost a year and a half, and with my track record... I'm extremely pleased.  I'm ready for my marketing class... bring it on.

I can't stand cigarettes.  I also can't stand people who whine about not having any money when they have a cigarette fund.

I'm really really tempted to start a web site.  Host my photos, both of my blogs, contact info, as well as just a way for me to store data on the web for easy personal access.

I'm also really really tempted to buzz my head.  I think I'm going to do this later this week.  Shawn's girlfriend has volunteered to do the trimming... now just to find some clippers.

Sturgis Falls is here.  I probably won't attend much.

Little Caesar's "Hot and Ready" $5 large pizzas are about the best thing ever invented.

Little Caesar's Crazy Bread for $2 comes in close 2nd.

This was nowhere near as short as I thought it would be.  /fail.
