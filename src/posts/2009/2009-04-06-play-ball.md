![](images/fantasy-baseball_msp_07082008.jpg)Sorry that I haven't been writing lately... I've been running around like crazy, trying to find a job and get everything back in order to return to the University of Northern Iowa in the fall.  But somehow, I knew that no matter how long I was away, that I'd be back this evening.  Why?  Easy.  It's Opening Night for baseball.

And what a game.  Short of a Red Sox/Yankees opener, there's really only 1 other team that I'd like to see for the first game of the season more than the Braves (that team being the Cubs)... but since the Phillies won the World Series last night, I figure it's only fair that they get to play.  But the Braves... man, I love watching the Braves.  Something about the Braves has just appealed to me since my youngster days of watching Glavine, Maddux, and Smoltz all pitch for the same team; that old-school style of baseball that they play so well.  Add Derek Lowe on the mound, and some young, fundamentally-sound players, and Atlanta becomes a delight to watch.  At this point in time, the 2nd inning just finished, and the Braves are already up 4-0 off of 3 home runs.

So for the first time ever, I'm playing Fantasy Baseball with some friends of mine.  I kinda spaced everything off until Draft Night, and then I went on a "Oh my goodness, how do I draft?" spree, checking ESPN's fantasy info, reading blog and forum posts, and so on.  Overall, I think I did pretty good for myself... here's what I got.

**C:** Dioner Navarro (Tampa Bay) **1B:** Carlos Peña (Tampa Bay) **2B:** Dustin Pedroia (Boston, my #1 pick) **3B:** Evan Longoria (Tampa Bay) **SS:** Troy Tulowitzki (Colorado) **Outfielders:** Matt Kemp (LA Dodgers), Jacoby Ellsbury (Boston), Jay Bruce (Cincinnati), Shin-Soo Choo (Cleveland), and JD Drew (Boston) **Utility:** Aubrey Huff (1/3B, Baltimore) and Carlos Delgado (1B, NY Mets) **Bench:** Placido Polanco (2B, Detroit), Jarrod Saltalamacchia (C, Texas), Brian Giles (OF, SD Padres), Orlando Cabrera (SS, Oakland), and David DeJesus (OF, Kansas City) **Starting Pitchers:** Brandon Webb (Arizona), Daisuke Matsuzaka (Boston), Ryan Dempster (Chi. Cubs), Hiroki Kuroda (LA Dodgers) **Relief Pitchers:** Jonathan Papelbon (Boston), Carlos Marmól (Chi. Cubs), Bobby Jenks (Chi. White Sox), Takashi Saito (Boston) **Other Pitchers:** Randy Johnson (San Fransisco), Gavin Floyd (Chi. White Sox), Oliver Perez (NY Mets), Gil Meche (Kansas City) **Disabled List:** Trevor Hoffman (Milwaukee)

Yeah, it's a little strange with all the players we've got, but it works out nicely.  Saito was picked up when I figured out how to use the DL for my team, and he'll probably get the boot when Hoffman comes back.  2 days after the draft, we were notified that Marmól wasn't going to be the Cubs closer, so I'm not sure what I'm going to do about that; if he's going to be the designated setup man/off day closer, I might hold onto him.

And no, I'm not biased towards Boston.  Truly, the only 2 players I was specifically targeting were Pedroia and Papelbon... Drew and Ellsbury just fell into my lap, while Saito was picked up as a replacement.  Heck, look at my infield.  3/5ths of it is from Tampa.  But there is one key trend that will last all season long... NO YANKEES ON MY TEAM!!!!  That \*was\* a bias on my part... I almost picked up Damon at one point (I figured he was a former Red Sox player, so it wouldn't be too terrible), but I ended off passing.

To be honest, I'm really excited about my team.  The one thing I'm missing for my team is a true power hitter (like a Pujols or Fielder or something), but Peña should produce nicely for me.  For my maiden voyage into live fantasy drafting, I feel like I did really really well.

 If you enjoyed reading my blog... well, I hope you'll stick around again.  Baseball's back, and that means that I am too.
