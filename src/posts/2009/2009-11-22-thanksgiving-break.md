Ah, sweet sweet vacation-y bliss.  The downside to school is that it's nonstop for nearly 16 weeks.  The upside is that we get a week break right near the end, just in time for a recharge.  And yet, at the same time, I've got enough stuff to do to keep me busy.

\- Read.  I'm going to find books, and read for fun.  I haven't done that in a long, long time. - Video games.  The new Call of Duty has been spinning in my PS3 for about 2 weeks now, and I'm going to play the hell out of that over break. - Listen to music.  I put together a playlist with about 10 days worth of music, and it's been playing non-stop since last night.  I plan on keeping this trend going.  Adding a little atmosphere to this crappy 14x10 dorm room can't hurt. - Guitar.  Lots of guitar.  Gotta practice. - Studying.  I have a test the Monday after break (Macro Econ), a paper due Tuesday (Humanities), and some general reading to do (Info Systems and Physics), plus an old lecture to watch (Physics).  Mostly for my sake rather than yours, but that's my study list for the week. - Sleep.  I have been neglecting that a bit lately, but I'm going to attempt to catch up.  However, I hate wasting my days, so waking up at 2pm today really sucked.  11am will be fine. - Clean my room.  I'll write about this more in depth later in the week (no, not about cleaning my room... you'll understand). - Blog.  I'd like to get about 4 or 5 posts up this week, on a couple different subjects.  My sports blog has been feeling lonely lately too, so maybe I'll try and get something up on there as well. - Work out.  Attempting to hit up the WRC on Mon-Wed, before it closes for the remainder of break, will make me feel a little better about myself.  I keep dropping weight (in a healthy way, thank you), but I'm still not satisfied.

Not really sure what else.  Maybe that's it.  That is quite a bit, I guess.  I'll probably still complain that I'm bored, since the few friends that are still around UNI are leaving either tomorrow or Monday.
