You know what's frustrating?

People saying "I wish" this, or "I want" that.

It's not that they're being selfish, or negative, or things like that... No, the frustrating this is that these people are your friends, and everything that they are wishing or longing for is something that you would happily offer to them in an instant.

Have you ever once stopped to think that the people you talk to, the people you consider your friends, are there for you? People step up to be your friend whenever you need one... someone to talk to, someone to cry with, whatever you need. We constantly step up to support you in your times of need, and you shit all over us... and you know what? We keep coming back, and we keep caring... because that's what friends do.

Don't ever, EVER, question my friendship and my dedication, nor my motivation. I can talk to you, I can be your friend, I can hang out with you, and I'm not going to ask for anything more than that. Respect me? I'll treat you with respect. Disrespect me? Well, I'll keep respecting you anyway. Disrespect my friends? That's when I get angry.

And don't ever think that I need a higher motivation to hang around you. I don't want your money, your car, or anything. I spend time with people who I care about. If you can't get over that, fine. If my friendship isn't something that you want, fine. Then man (or woman) up, say something, and let's move on.

On a more positive note... I've hit the gym a couple times this week, and it feels good.  The old guys that play ball at the WRC around noon are crafty... and by crafty, I mean vicious.  I've made myself a promise... I'm allowing myself 2-3 beers with my friends on Monday nights, but otherwise, I'm not drinking or going out to eat until I drop 10lbs.  Shouldn't be too difficult.

Aaaaand... I have a job!  I'm back working at Hy-Vee again, but this time in the produce department (as opposed to being a courtesy clerk waaaay back in the day).  It feels great to know that income is on its way... I've been living off of unemployment since January, and claiming it as my only income source for about 2 months.  Definitely doable, but not recommended.
