It's amazing the kind of productivity you can accomplish when you are ill... I'm pretty impressed with myself.

- Physics: 1 online lecture watched, 1 quiz taken (twice), 1 test studied for/taken
- Humanities: 4 (yes, 4) papers written.  1 to go yet today.
- Personal Wellness: 9 online lectures watched.  Playing a little catchup.
- Info Systems: .... not much.  Working through a packet that wasn't due after all.  Oh well.  Studying for a test
- Macro: Multiple chapters read, notes taken, test prep pretty much done.
- 2.5 weeks worth or laundry done
- Move completed (I live in Shull 153 now, so come visit)

Um... that's it.  For now, I guess.  Hard to write a blog in class.
