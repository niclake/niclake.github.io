![](images/Terminator3-09.jpg)I promise, this isn't just an excuse to get Ah-nold on my blog (first Fabio, now this?  Yeesh...).

First, the bad.  There are days that I really hate computers.  Today is one of those.  I got home from my classes to find my internet shut off by ResNet, the university's internet provider.  They had gotten notice of a copyright infringement which claimed I was torrenting some file.  My first reaction... gawuh?!?

- The only torrent-ready program was one I had used back in my very very early World of Warcraft days (in order to download patches on patch day, you sometimes had to go to external sources... otherwise it was suuuuuuuuuuuuuper sloooooooooooooow).  My machine was completely incapable of running WoW at anywhere above 10 frames per second, so I used a crappy PC for all of that.
- I don't torrent.  I've been burned by the university once previously for sharing stuff via Limewire, and I knew that any more infringements would get me shut down for a month (not something I'm really a fan of, especially around finals time).  I also stopped using Transmission before this occurred.

So that's that... right?  Nope.

- Apparently, even though I never used Transmission, it was listed as a startup item on my computer, one that was hidden and listed as an "unknown" application type (very strange).
- I actually deleted the application from my computer this morning (doing a bit of spring cleaning... more on that in a bit), which actually makes me look guilty, but I stepped up and admitted that (not strange)...
- ... but when I deleted the app, some related items went along with it.  Some of those were crash reports, dated about a month ago (previous to when my "file sharing tomfoolery" started), so obviously the application was running, and at some point, it stopped running.  (extremely strange, since I never was notified)
- I did a search on my computer, trying to find any files related to the application, torrents, or the torrent I was accused of downloading.  I also had a technician (and friend of mine) from ResNet make a pass.  Neither of us found anything (strange, considering the circumstances).
- My mother's computer had this affliction at one point in time.  I worked at CFU (the local utility plant/internet provider), and we got a copyright infringement notice that stemmed from her IP address (when I was living at the dorms).  I stopped over and checked it (surprise, Mom), didn't notice anything, restarted the computer, and never heard of these issues again (odd).

I just don't really know what's going on.  I get to meet with the Dean of Students tomorrow and try to get my 'net turned back on.  Otherwise, I have nothing available to me except for computer lab access for the next 30 days.  This sucks, because I was planning on being around the dorms for the holiday break (moving home and back when I'm 2 miles away just seems dumb).

Also... I spoke with my parents over Thanksgiving, and they decided to help me in purchasing a new computer to replace my ancient PowerBook G4 (ancient by technology standards anyway...).  So... the Wednesday of finals week (right when I finish), my new 27" iMac i7 2.8GHz quad-core computer should be arriving.

I can't even begin to explain how excited I am.

For one, I'll finally be included with the Intel crowd, since my PowerBook was the final series of Apple computers that featured PowerPC.  I'll also be making a huge step up in my processing power, going from a 1.5GHz single core machine to a 2.8GHz quad-core... nearly 7.5 times the power.  Yum.  Also, 4GB of RAM (vs. the 2 I have now), a 1TB hard drive (instead of 80GB)... not to mention a massive screen (27" vs. 15").  It would suck pretty badly if I didn't have internet for it.  I spent a couple hours doing some spring cleaning, figuring out what apps I would need to get on the new machine, getting rid of old/duplicate documents, etc... now I might not be able to utilize it fully... vunderbar.

Rawr.

It sucks too, cause this day was going so well.  I had to get up and work at 8, and had a test at 10.  Well, I did great on the test (18/20, which will end off translating into an A after the curve is applied), and then found out that I'm completely finished with all assignments in my Info Systems class (I thought that my HTML project was due the Friday before break... it's due the last Friday of the semester... oops), and I only have to go on days where the teacher will be lecturing over the book (i.e. this Friday and next Wednesday), so I'm pretty thrilled about that.  Then I got back, and this happened.

Double rawr.

So tomorrow, I get to go meet with the Dean of Students and discuss all this.  I have no idea if he's tech savvy or not... either I'll be able to explain this exactly as is, or I'll have to dumb it down for a non-computer guy.  I'm not sure which of those options I'm dreading more.
