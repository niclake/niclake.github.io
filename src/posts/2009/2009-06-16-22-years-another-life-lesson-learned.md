So I discovered 2 things about myself this evening.

Maybe I should clarify that a little bit.  By "discovered", I really mean "finally payed attention to what everyone has been telling me all along".  Actually, I need to re-do my opening sentence now...

So I discovered finally payed attention to 2 3 things about myself this evening.

1) (actually just learned as I write this) People have pointed numerous things out to me over the years, and I have just chosen not to listen to them.  I can be pretty stubborn at times, which I've known for years, but when I don't take the logical advice of some of my good friends or family, that's when things kinda get hairy.

2) I am extremely impulsive.  I learned that the hard way tonight.  I went to play poker with some friends with the intention to only play with $5.  When I went out on crappy luck after about 30 minutes, I thought "eh, why not?", and suddenly $5 more was in the pot... then $10.  By the end of the night, I'd bled out quite a bit, and was sitting with $19 in the game.  I ended off recovering nicely, then getting kinda screwed on the last river, and finished the game with $5.  So down $14 total.  In the long run, I can justify this by saying that I would've probably spent just as much at Wing/2-for-1 pitchers night at Becks... but a) it's money I should not have been spending, and b) I went in saying I'd only spend X, and spent 4X (ish).

Ouch.

And it's not just relegated to money, though I'm sure my parents will attest to the fact that I have done this with money pretty much all my life (thus, whomever I marry... please be good with managing money.  I'll love you extra.  Thanks).  I've given up decent jobs because a "better" (read: easier) opportunity came along, or gone on a weekend vacation trip to the Mall of America or a Vikings game just because I was bored.  I go disc golfing twice in one day because I "needed a study break".  There's other, more personal things that I've done as well, one of which I still kick myself about to this day.  A lot of the decisions that I can chalk up in the "stupid" category can be attributed to my impulsiveness.

3) I'm incredibly lazy.  Again, my parents will attest to this.  I am a sub-par poker player, not because I play bad cards or whatnot, but because I'm too lazy to pay attention to people's habits until it's too late.  I'm what (I guess) a lot of people would deem to be one with a far-above-average intelligence, but I do terrible in school because I don't want to work... this was in part to the fact that I made it all the way up to my senior year of high school while barely cracking open a textbook.  I'm a very good guitar player, but not outstanding, only because I don't really want to take the time to practice (which is stupid, considering how much I love music).  I haven't worked out at the WRC in 2 weeks, not because I'm busy with work/class, but because I'm just too lazy to go over there.  I've given up 1 job because I just didn't want to go.  I took a year off of school because of a couple reasons, but the most prominant was the fact that I didnt apply myself enough since 5th grade in all aspects of life, school included.  I didn't make All-State my junior year of high school because I thought I was "the shit" and didn't apply myself.  I stopped being a computer science major (which can make the $$$ in this day and age) because I felt it just wasn't right for me... and it wasn't right for me because I really didn't even try.  Obviously, I've managed to cover a variety of bases, from things that I love, to things I can at least tolerate, all the way down to things I disliked.  Most of the other decisions that are in that "stupid" category are due to my laziness.  The others?  Probably just random acts of... well, stupidness.

I had a stressful weekend due to some stuff around my apartment (if you're curious, you can ask, but since it's mostly resolved I won't elaborate further), a test to study for, a paper to write, and then playing poker this evening.  Hell, even some of my rounds of disc golf frustrated me.  Add to that the "revelations" that I had driving home from poker this evening, and that all just adds up to one giant pile of frustration and emotions.  Add to that the epic headache that I've had for 2 days... I don't mean to whine, but seriously... a little slack would be super.

So I guess the million dollar question is... what do I do about my impulsiveness, my laziness, and my not-listening-ness?

Well, it's safe to say that I'm off to a good start on the laziness thing.

Also, you know you're tired and not thinking clearly when you see a ball eat up an outfielder, watch him run forward as he tries to get a handle on it, and instinctively think "TRAVELING!!!"

Sorry... impulsive, see?  Anyway... I told myself that I'd sit down and write this post not only for whomever actually reads this, but for myself, as I was driving home tonight.  Obviously, I'm multitasking and watching Sportscenter at the same time... oops.  But, I've gotten this written in a decent amount of time, so that's good.  I had a test today, my first one in over a year, and even though I slacked off a bit on Saturday, I buckled down and got studying taken care of, and did pretty good (I think) on my test.  Tomorrow, I have class, and then I'm going to force myself to go work out at the WRC.

As far as the impulsive... well, being impulsive and not listening to those that are close to me are tied in close together, so maybe I'll start there.  Beyond that, I'm working at tracking my spending, setting priorities for myself, and so on.  I'm not expecting this to be something that gets "fixed" overnight, but I can hope that I can at least make a positive change immediately, and keep things going from there.

And for those of you that have been there for me and tried to motivate and/or restrain me over these last few years... thank you.  Sorry I didn't listen.  I know that your heart was in the right place, and it was just my stupidity that was blinding me.

\*le sigh\*
