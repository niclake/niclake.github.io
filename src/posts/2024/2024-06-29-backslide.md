This is a post about politics. You don't have to read it. But maybe you should.

The root of *"progressive"* is *"progress"*. The main goal of progress is to *move forward*, bit by bit, no matter how slowly. It's like weight loss, or learning a new skill. You're *NEVER* gonna make that leap from A to Z. You have to go the path, and take it day by day, and keep the big picture in mind. Because the second goal of progress is to *minimize the backslide*.

And you're gonna backslide. Things are gonna trip you up. You might have all this momentum and everything feels good and then BAM you're gonna have a tree fall on your garage and be really stressed out and eat half a pizza for dinner and whoops you gained a pound. And if you sit and stare at the scale and go "oh no, +1.0 lbs? *I've failed*" then you might fail. But if you look at your log and go "huh, I'm still -9.3 lbs for the month, *that's ahead of schedule!*", then you can easily get back on track.

Or maybe you go into an election year trying to vote a narcissistic fascist out of office, and you're all hyped up behind your progressive candidate, but then various groups come along and say "we're not ready for a woman to be President" or "he's too radical" or "he's not radical enough" or "she's gonna be a member of the Republican party in 2 years" or whatever, and suddenly you find yourself with a candidate that's not too hot and not too cold, but *juuuuuuuust* boring enough to win the popular vote. And we all celebrate but inside we're like "well, that could've been better". And then 4 years go by and we're voting for that same tepid bowl of blah against that same narcissistic fascist who's somehow both MORE narcissistic and MORE fascist than before, and this doesn't look like progress, and suddenly we're looking for someone to blame.

[There's a post](https://twitter.com/TimGrierson/status/1008907610890702848) making the rounds lately that says "Being angry all the time is exhausting and corrosive. Not being angry feels morally irresponsible." I couldn't agree more with both parts. Being a progressive and wanting better for this country sucks sometimes. It's hard. The answers seem so obvious to all of us, but there's political gridlock and centrists not wanting to upset the cart and the 1.5 year lull from when the President is sworn in until midterms happen.

I wonder, when y'all decided to tune in to the debate this week, what exactly were you watching for? Did you anticipate learning something about a candidate? Are you (somehow) an undecided voter? Were you watching for the lulz? Hate watching?[^1]

[^1]: I had a lovely excuse to not pay attention - it was at my daughter's bedtime, so I was busy. I laid down next to her and held her hand and it was pure bliss.

I'm seeing SO MANY PEOPLE say things like "well Biden isn't any better than Trump, they're both just old white men losing their minds and shouldn't be running the country." **AGREED!**

Some are saying "well no, Biden's not *as bad* as Trump. He's just old and needs to retire." **ALSO AGREED!**

And some say"If you back Biden, you're as responsible for ruining the country as someone who votes for Trump." **HOLD THE *FUCK* UP!**

You're not getting married to the President. You don't have to post *"JUST VOTED FAM #BIDENBOY #CUPOFJOE"*. Y'all don't even have to LIKE it. But god*DAMN*, we do not need to pretend that Joe Biden == Donald Trump.

My mind has been made up since Biden was elected President for his first term, knowing that it was highly likely that he'd be running for re-election. Joe Biden is getting my vote, specifically and only because he's NOT Donald Trump.

We all knew this was coming. Every single one of us. If you thought "well maybe he'd step down for Kamala" or "maybe a progressive would primary him" or anything like that, you're either lying to us, or lying to yourself.

Absolutely nobody is (or should be) saying "oh, chin up, stay positive." Be pissed. Be angry. Be furious. Trump's gonna be moping in Mar-A-Lago anyway; don't let him do it with the title "45.2". He's a parasite we have to outlast. Minimize the backslide.
