Hopefully, if you subscribe to my RSS feed, this is the only post you're seeing today, and you're not inundated with [checks notes] 382 additional notifications.

On Monday, I got the bright idea in my head to see if I could find old versions of my site. That led me to look for old versions of my .com address, before it was snagged by a domain sniper. Then THAT led me to track down my really old blogs from my college days.

I'll be honest, I don't actually know what prompted this. I'm not a sentimental person by any means, but for whatever reason, the desire to drag all this content out of the depths was there.

My stuff was kinda scattered. I had 2 old blogs on Wordpress - one a personal site (The Music Plays You, which ended up being my music project name), and a sports blog for when I wanted to try and be a sports writer (Words To Play By) - and a Tumblr backend for my old .com. Thankfully, it was trivial to export all of the content. I was able to use [a Wordpress Export to Markdown tool](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) to get everything bulk converted for my current site. Tumblr was shaping up to be more of a pain, but I only had about 50 posts make the transition from there, so I ended up just fleshing those out by hand.

I also had a moment of clarity that I used to be an editor & write for [Macgasm](http://macgasm.net) back in the day. [I only made 38 posts while I was there](https://news.macgasm.net/author/niclake/), but those were just too topical and unimportant to bring over.

If I did everything correctly:

- You should see all of the really really old posts on my blog, either [in the archive](/blog/) or [bloating all of the tags](/blog/tags/).
- None of the posts should've shown up in the RSS feed.
- My shame is now on display for all to see.

Over the coming days, I'm gonna have to go back and fix/prune a lot of stuff. Tons of photos, especially on the sports blog, that just don't exist anywhere anymore, along with what I presume will be a bunch of mucked up formatting. As long as my site compiles, I'm rolling with it for now.

I'm also going to dig out a bunch of older posts. Some were inspirational/deep thoughts. Some were hilarious. And some were just plain bad. It should be a good time.
