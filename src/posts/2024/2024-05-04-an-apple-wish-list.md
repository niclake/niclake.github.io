We're about to get an Apple Event on Tuesday. This is going to be the first one in a while that I'm probably not going to get to watch; I'll be driving back from vacation that day, so it would be highly irresponsible of me to try and tune in.

So, you know... maybe.

I bought my first Apple computer (a Titanium PowerBook G4) in the summer of 2005. I've been using Apple computers in various forms since the mid 90s. I've been entrenched in the ecosystem for a long time, and I'm now able to use Macs as part of my career, which is pretty great.

I'd consider myself to be a staunch Apple fanboy, but there are still a _ton_ of things that I wish Apple would make better, and today I'm going to use this space to put them into the world and hope for the best. In no particular order:

- A standalone Touch ID sensor, and/or one that's baked in to the Magic Trackpad
- Apple Music on the Mac [lets you shuffle by album](/one-software-feature) - why is this not the case on iPhone?
- Why does my Apple Watch insist that I have 2 lists titled Grocery List when I try to use Siri to add something? (No matter which one I choose, it ends up on the right spot, but I shouldn't have to confirm it.)
- Please give us an iPhone Pro Mini.
- Why does ANYTHING still use Lightning? USB-C for everything already, c'mon.
- Why is sharing something via iCloud with a family member so wildly inconsistent and/or unintuitive?
- Widgets should have an "extra small" size option thats just the size of an app icon. Also, every app should be able to dynamically set their app icon if the user enables it (i.e. Fantastical should be able to show me the date).

I'm sure I have more deep in my bag, but these are my main ones right now. Do you have any gripes?
