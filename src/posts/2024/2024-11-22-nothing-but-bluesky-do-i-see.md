*TL;DR [I'm on Bluesky now][profile]. If you miss early Twitter, you should come hang out.*

Social media used to be good. [It sucks now](/fuck-social-media/), but it used to be good.[^1]

[^1]: I talk in the linked post there about my entire history with social media. Check it out if you want.

Gone are the days of Facebook being for college students only. Gone are the days of 140 character limits.  Gone are the days where a social media presence wasn't mandatory for existing in this world.

Gone, too, are the days where the Bird Site wasn't a complete toxic cesspool.

For all the bad, I still miss the good. Which, hooray, that's what getting older is all about, right? I miss Lich King-era WoW. Late 00s screamo. 90s era Surge. We pine for days of yore, when our decisions didn't have such a profound impact on our physical, mental, and emotional health.

Social media was something I enjoyed, for a ton of reasons. Now, it's something I dip into when I'm bored or tired. The negativity got to be too much, and I just didn't want to have anything to do with it.

And then... the election happened, and everyone *finally* said "yeah fuck this".

I've been on Mastodon for a while now, and was hopeful that it would get a solid foothold in the social media wars. Sadly, it lost out to Threads, which sucks in its own ways. So when people started to flee, I wondered, where exactly were they going to go?

For whatever reason, Bluesky was the place. And I'm so happy for that.

I don't think I'm ever going to be as chronically online as I was pre-pandemic. It's not healthy, and with a kid, I just don't have that kind of free time anymore.

But when I tell you that I'm getting that 2015 Twitter feeling again from Bluesky? Where everyone is present and engaged and shitposting and having fun? I've missed it so much. And maybe, just maybe, I can have a little bit of fun again, as a treat.

I don't think it'll last forever. Capitalism exists, and server costs exist, and stakeholders always want more more more. So I'll just take what I can get, for as long as I can get it, and hope that it sticks around for as long as possible.
