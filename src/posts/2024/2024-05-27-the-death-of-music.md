Earlier this month, I talked about [other jobs I might have had](/when-i-grow-up) if things had bounced a different way. The first three things talked about various instruments I played. A few people have asked whether I still play or not.

(Today ended up turning into a VERY long post; if you want a TL;DR, click this footnote.)[^1]

[^1]: My mom had her masters in piano performance, but also had arthritis that made it very difficult for her to play. She taught piano out of our home for as long as I can remember. When I was four, I sat down at the piano and made some comment about how I wanted to learn how to play. In hindsight, my mom lived vicariously through me and pushed me to be what she couldnâ€™t. I was really fucking good. But the mental trauma of being forced to do do that for years lives with me still, and makes me not want to touch an instrument.

My relationship with music is weird. I love listening to music, but I prioritize podcasts over it nowadays. I loved playing, but would often find myself getting frustrated with the other musicians around me, or not wanting to let loved ones hear me noodle around for whatever reason. I enjoy writing & recording, but I'm such a harsh self-critic that things often just get mired in limbo (like the [sixth demo version of a song](https://soundcloud.com/themusicplaysyou/anchor-yourselffoundations-demo-6) I've had rattling around since the day after I released my EP in 2013).

The more I unpack it, the more it goes all the way back to the very beginning.

I mentioned how I asked to learn piano when I was 4. What I didn't mention was that my mom had her Masters in piano performance, and for as long as I could remember, taught piano to (mostly) kids in my hometown. She was an outstanding teacher; students who cared even a little bit would turn into terrific pianists. Many would do really well at the regional and state-wide competitions. My mom had a true gift.

My mom also had arthritis in her hands. It made it difficult for her to play, and really the only time I ever remember her playing was when she would be going over new music she had received to figure out what it sounded like. As I wrote that last sentence, it sank in that my mom could sight-read music better than I ever could, and gave me a new appreciation for her talent.

As I look back, what ended up happening was that my mom lived vicariously through me, driving me to be just as good of a piano player (or better) than she was. And I ended up being *very* good.

She quickly realized that it would be beneficial for me to receive instruction from another piano teacher (because who wants to listen to their parents?), so I started taking lessons from a woman named Joan. Joan was a great teacher in her own right, and helped me flourish between ages 5 and 10.

Every morning, I would wake up early (5:30ish?), practice piano under the direction of my mom (somewhere between 1 to 2 hours, depending on my age), and then go to school. Every Tuesday after school, I'd go to Joan's for an hour long lesson. *It was like I was receiving 8 lessons every week.*

When I was 10, I phased out of the skill level that Joan taught[^2], so we started driving 25 minutes to a nearby college to take lessons from a professor there (Dr. Reuter). For 7-8 years, he instructed me, and I grew into a monster musician.

[^2]: For youth competitions, there were basically 6 skill levels, A through F. Joan mostly did A & B level teaching.

This is the same time frame where my parents ended up getting me a drum set, then a bass, and then a guitar (with private lessons for all of them), I joined band at school, & ended up becoming an All-State percussionist twice. I also got heavily involved with the praise band at our church, eventually working as a roaving session musician for 4 churches over the next 15 years.

---

Through all of this time, everything was "practice, practice, practice". 1.5 hours of piano before school, 2 on the weekends. Also, practicing for band, practicing for drumline, practicing for percussion lessons. My parent bought me a marimba that sat in my bedroom, so that I could practice that at home every day. My piano lessons on Tuesdays. Guitar for church. Guitar lessons. All on top of school, reading, playing basketball at the rec center, and whatever else I got up to as a kid.

My mom and I fought *constantly*. She would set a timer on our microwave for how long I had to practice, and would hover downstairs providing feedback and instruction as I did. She'd often boost my time up by 5 minutes to extend my time; I'd often sneak in really quick and decrease my time by 5 minutes here and there. At some point, someone learned that if you set the clock on the microwave a specific way, it would disable the beeping from every button press. This made things a million times worse.

When my arm started to give out from tendonitis[^3], I felt relief. After consulting a doctor, it was determined that something had to give. I'd already walked away from playing basketball[^4], and I'd already started thinking about pursuing music ed for percussion in college, so reluctantly my mom let me stop playing piano.

[^3]: The three leading causes of tendonitis development in children in the early 2000s were piano, percussion, and basketball. Guess who learned this the hard way? (I'm guessing today it's "typing on a keybiard" which, hey, that's my day job!)
[^4]: I never got to play organized sports, because "what if something happens to your hands?" All I ever got to do was play rec league baseball in the summers. Any time I jammed my fingers, I'd have to suffer and push through it.

When I hit the chime during that wind symphony concert at the end of freshman year and felt my tendon in my wrist snap, I felt agony... but also, more relief. I'd been able to coast through most of high school music based on raw talent, but college was putting me through the ringer. I'd also started dabbling in the first few music ed courses, and realized very quickly that teaching music was going to be extremely difficult for me. So much of what I knew and could do was raw talent that I'd honed over the years, vs. a learned skill. I could get the right answers in music theory, but couldn't tell you *why* they were right.

But still, I soldiered on with music. Strumming a guitar was a lateral bend that didn't seem to aggravate my wrist and elbow as much, so I poured all of my energy into that. Playing at church every other weekend, with rehearsals on Thursdays. Sitting in as a sub for guitar or bass. Helping out with Wednesday night youth services. Joining a band that toured around the midwest.

After a few years, my arm healed to the point where I felt I could trust it. This coincided with a change in churches for me, and a tripling down of my time playing music. We had 3 teams that rotated through weekends, and I often found myself on 2 of them. Thursday rehearsal, Saturday service, Sunday 2 services. Then Sunday night college youth service. Then Wednesday, helping lead the high school service. Then on the off Thursdays, helping with another college service. It was nonstop. But I told myself I was enjoying it. When I graduated college & moved an hour south to another metro for work, *I still volunteered on a 3 week rotation at the church back home*.[^5] I started making music in my bedroom as my primary hobby. I auditioned to play guitar for three bands/artists[^6], and didn't get them because I was too short.

[^5]: This isn't a boast. This is an "oh shit".
[^6]: Two of which are currently doing something called "The Eras Tour".

And then my mom died, 2 days before my 26th birthday. It coincided with me releasing [my first and only EP](/sailing).

I was on the schedule for church that weekend. I thought, what better way to honor my mom's legacy than to perform?

She died on Monday. I had rehearsal on Thursday. Her funeral was on Friday. I had services to perform at Saturday and Sunday. I was back at work on Monday morning.

It's been nearly 9 years since I've done anything substantial or meaningful with my instruments. I sold all of my amps and pedals, relying on [digital amp simulators](/uses#software-2) if I want to play guitar. I inherited my mom's piano, but I've only played it for maybe an hour total in those 9 years.[^7]

[^7]: House shopping with a baby grand piano sucks butt. The first thing I asked myself with every house we looked at was "ok, where can we put the piano?" It ruled out a couple of really nice houses (and a ton of shitty ones).

I love music. I'd love to get back into writing new music again, or finding an outlet to perform. But *every time* I touch an instrument, I soon feel a sense of dread come over me that I just don't want to muck around with. (I'm not-so-secretly hoping this post is a bit cathartic in helping with that.)

Then my daughter discovered that pushing the keys on the piano made noise. And "piano, Daddy!" became a thing.

V is 2. She now has her own little piano, a xylophone, and a small percussion set. She loves to sing, and have us sing to her ("Daddy, sing Baby Shark"). She loves music, even the loud progressive metal that I tend to enjoy nowadays.

I'm watching her grow, and looking at that piano sitting in our front room, and worrying about repeating traumas with her that were imparted on to me. We've thought about selling the piano, but I don't know if I'm quite ready for that yet, and it would probably break my dad's heart. So there it sits, unused except when V goes over and pokes at the keys.

I wish I knew how best to proceed. Slogging through it because I think I might still enjoy it is off the table. I'm really good at ignoring it, but eventually I'm going to have to reckon with that monstrosity sitting in the front room.

I know that my mom meant well when she imparted all of her wisdom on to me. I'd shown interest, she had the ability to teach me, and she did an incredible job at transforming me into an amazing musician. When I'd protest, though, I was met with "no, you can't quit".

Society has progressed a lot since the 90s, and I learned a ton over the years about both how I want to raise my kid (lots of books, speaking to them like an adult, etc.), but also how I *don't* want to do things. My wife and I have already had talks about how we'll handle V wanting to do something like a sport, but deciding mid-season that she's not interested anymore - do we let her drop it at a whim, or force her to see it through since she committed to her teammates, coaches, etc.? And I think, what if she asks me to teach her an instrument? How would I handle that?

I always used to define myself as a musician, but I've started to wonder recently if that's truly me, or what someone else wanted from me. Was it my passion, or my mom's? Is there a way for me to find joy from these talents anymore, or is there too much mental trauma surrounding it that I'm going to end up abandoning something that basically consumed all of my formative years?

I don't know the answer yet. But I need to figure it out soon, before history repeats itself.
