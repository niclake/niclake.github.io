I write because sometimes, it's just helpful to get a thought off my chest, and process it through my fingertips.

I write because maybe someone out there reads what I am thinking and goes "hey, me too!"

I write because it's cheaper than therapy.[^1]

[^1]: It's not a substitute... but sometimes it's enough.

I write because often times I have a whole bunch to say about a topic, and never have the right venue. Plus, I know that once I start writing, it'll take forever for me to hit the brakes, and being able to edit myself before hitting "send" is sometimes to everyone's benefit. Nothing like killing off friendships because you just had to get a word in edgewise.

I write to learn brevity.

I write because that one time in high school, when I was taking creative writing, I wrote something that my teacher thought was mildly concerning depression-wise, but rather than report me to the principal, she took the time out of her day to talk to me and make sure I was good; after all, it *was* just a creative writing exercise.[^2]

[^2]: I was just a little emo kid when I wrote it on a Thurs/Fri; when she talked to me on Monday everything was better.

I write because I learned from an early age how important and amazing reading is, and I hoped one day to be able to give that back to future generations.

I write because my entire thought process is analogies and comparisons, and those don't always make sense to others unless I get them into words.

I write because I love the sound of my keyboards as I hit each key, and I get that feeling of satisfaction as I *clack clack clack* through a post.

I write because it's fun. I write because it sucks. I write because I'm a good writer. I write because I'm a bad writer.

I write because writing is a creative process. A rambling series of sentences can become a cohesive story. I can create something out of an ephemeral thought[^3], and publish it with the click of a button. I can make it, then stand up and walk away, knowing that others get a chance to see what I made. Or not! Maybe nobody reads it.

[^3]: I write because I enjoy flowery words like "ephemeral" but don't always have good opportunities to use them in MeatSpace.

I write, and I hope you write too, because knowing each other through our published thoughts is such an Old Way of the Internetâ„¢ type of thing, and I love it so much.
