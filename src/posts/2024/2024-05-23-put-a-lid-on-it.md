2 things happened when I entered high school that changed who I was forever.

1. I discovered that the school had a policy that allowed students to wear hats all the time.[^1]
2. One of my best friends gave me a new hat for my birthday.

[^1]: Individual teachers could say "no hats in my class". My 10th grade Spanish class teacher was the only one who made me take it off. I only remember 2 things from her class: "chinita", which she said meant "little Chinese girl" but apparently means "ladybug"?, and "¡No ay shit en la clase de español!", or "No saying shit in [my] Spanish class!"

Now, it wasn't just *any* hat. No, it was a University of Nebraska hat. A school with which I have never and will never have any affiliation with. Why the heck would I wear this? "The N is for 'Nic'."? Seriously?

Reader, I swear to you, I wore that hat practically every day for almost 3 years. By the time it was retired, it had faded from the deep black of a new hat to a tan color. The brim had split and exposed the plastic underneath. I think I'd lost that little button on the very top. The metal sizing clasp got broken at some point, so my mom sewed it back together; it was my first fitted hat.

Eventually I got my first Red Sox hat, which received similar treatment over the years. But all it took was that stupid Nebraska hat to set me down a path that I've yet to come out of.

My taste in hats has certainly changed over the years. I used to be all in on 47brand hats. Lower profile, curved bill, not fitted, a bit floppy and loose. But, as someone who has worn glasses my whole life, I got tired of the bill of my hat always shoving my glasses around.

So, at some point over the last decade, I switched over to almost exclusively wearing New Era 59fifty hats. 6 Red Sox hats, one each for the Celtics, Vikings, Iowa Hawkeyes, and Iowa Cubs, plus a couple of novelty hats (and some Neff & Carhart beanies). My [hat wishlist](/wishlist/#hats) is always in need of pruning[^2] (which mostly happens when they go out of stock), and one of my pipe dreams is to some day have a hat collection for every MLB team. When we moved into our new house last year, I was able to finally store them all in a drawer in my office, which is perfect.

[^2]: My biggest regret was not buying [the Streakpop Red Sox hat](https://www.fittedhats.com/products/new-era-boston-red-sox-streakpop-59fifty-fitted-hat); I occasionally hunt the web to see if I can find one in my size. Alas.

Every once in a while, I'll post a photo of myself without a hat on, and some of my friends will inevitably say "I don't think I've ever seen you without a hat". Which, valid.[^3] I don't know what exactly prompted me to start wearing hats all those years ago; maybe it was a control thing? Something to make me feel like I stood out from my peers? Whatever it was, it's here to stay.

[^3]: I have the green Celtics hat on right now.

Apparently, even my kid knows about my hat obsession. We were just at the store, and I saw a hat that I thought was cool. I asked her "V, should I get this hat?" And she said "no Daddy, have hat" and touched the one on my head.

My wife has trained her well.
