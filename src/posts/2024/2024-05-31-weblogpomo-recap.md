We did it. Weblog Posting Month, or WeblogPoMo, has come to a close. Congrats to all who made it this far - it's been a lot of fun getting to know new people and learning more about y'all.

I feel like I learned a *lot* over the last few weeks, and thought I'd share a few of those things with you.

**Finding topics to write about is hard**. That was honestly my biggest struggle of the whole ordeal. I was able to lock in to the first 2 weeks worth of topics, and picked up some ideas here and there from other people, but there were days where it'd be 10pm and I'd have no idea what to write about. Thank you to anyone who offered ideas or voted on my polls.[^1]

[^1]: This is also why I normally post so infrequently; I only post when I have something to write about, and without being forced to write every day, I don't think about finding topics.

**Brevity is hard**. I could really use a good editor from time to time.

**Is this thing on?!?** Remember back in the day when everyone would have page counters on their websites? I do not miss those days at all. It's always a struggle wondering if the things you write are being read at all, especially when everyone is trying to get their posts seen by others as well.

(I will say, I appreciate every single person who went out of their way to toot me on Mastodon, boosted my posts so others would see, or write me an email. I loved knowing that various things that I wrote resonated with you to various degrees; honestly, that's why I write, is for others to read. And to that end...)

**Heartfelt is best**. Who cares about my [pruning of RSS feeds](/the-great-rss-pruning/)? Not many people. Who enjoys [a sappy post about my kid](/the-best-feeling/)? Or my [angry rant about AI](/ai/)? *Everyone*, apparently. The key differentiator: at least for me, the posts with emotion behind them resonated with far more people.

I had a terrific time with WeblogPoMo, and I'm already looking forward to next year.
