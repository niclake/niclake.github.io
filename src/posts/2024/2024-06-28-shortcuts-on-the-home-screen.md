I have recently gotten in to using Shortcuts to help me with various tasks in my life. It's a fantastic little tool that can be used for the most mundane things (switching on a Focus mode, adding the currently playing song to a specific playlist, and more), and it can also be used for incredibly powerful and full-featured things (when you hold the new Action button down, check the current orientation of the phone; if it's face-down or upside down, toggle the Silent Mode; otherwise, launch the Camera). The team over at MacStories has [a huge collection of Shortcuts & ideas](https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/), if you're so inclined.[^1]

[^1]: Jason Snell from [Six Colors](https://sixcolors.com) and many of your favorite podcasts gave me an idea for an obvious one this week; if you have a Roomba, you can create shortcuts for various rooms/zones you want to clean. Then create a Shortcuts widget folder on your Today View (swipe right on the home screen), and you can have them all there. Bonus: you don't even have to unlock your phone to get to those.

One of my gripes with Shortcuts, and probably the most important thing that's kept me from using them more frequently, is triggering them. I use Siri constantly, so saying "run X shortcut" isn't an issue for me. But there are others that it makes more sense to have as a button on my home screen, and that's long been an issue for me.

Take my Evening Focus mode screen, for instance. Here's what it was this morning. You see that big purple block that says "Reading"? That's my shortcut that I've added to my screen via a Shortcuts widget. Since a 2x2 square is the smallest widget you could have, it's either I have this big widget like this, or I could have one other sharing the space with it (but I have nothing of value to add).

This shortcut is basically a mini-launcher for me - when pressed, it shows me a menu asking me what I'd like to do:

{% include 'image.njk',

  position: "right",
  alt: "A photo of my Reading shortcut prompt."
%}

- open Kindle
- open Libby (checking out books from the library)
- open StoryGraph (how I track my reading)
- open Goodreads (the old way of tracking)
- open Albums (the app I use to listen to a playlist of albums on my phone)
- open Google Sheets (for my books tracker & catalog)
- run Send Book to Kindle (a shortcut that grabs an epub from Files and emails it to my actual Kindle)
- Toggle my Reading Focus mode

It does a bunch. It easily displaced 6 apps from my home screen, so it's worth the space it has taken up. But it has *always* eaten at me that I couldn't have an app icon-sized shortcut trigger on my home screen.

Readers.

When I tell you that you can, in fact, have an app icon-sized shortcut trigger, I hope you are as flabbergasted as I am. Because if I find out that y'all knew this and hid this from me for all these years, I'm going to be very upset.

It's *extremely* unintuitive to get to (which, it's modern Apple, so this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone), but it's also very easy.

- Open Shortcuts, and find your Shortcut
- Long press on it to bring up the option menu, and choose Share
- One of those options will be "Add to Home Screen"
- When you press on it, you can choose whatever icon and color you want, and give it a name
- Press Add, and *ta-daaaaaaa*, there it is

Anyway, now my home screen layouts are all sorts of buggered, so I need to go fix them. But hey, this is a good problem to have.
