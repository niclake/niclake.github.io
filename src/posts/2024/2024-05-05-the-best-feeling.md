The first sip of coffee in the morning.

When you put the final touches on something you make by hand, and you stand back to admire it.

When you finally beat a tough boss in a video game that’s been giving you fits for hours.

When you taste the food you’ve had going all afternoon, and it’s exquisite.

Stepping out on the balcony of your vacation rental, and taking a deep breath of morning air.

These are all things that are high up on the “best feelings” list, but there’s a new one that has topped the list for all time, at least for me:

*When your child sees you from across the room, shouts your name, and sprints to you to give you the biggest hug that they don’t want to let go of.*

That’s it. That’s the best feeling.
