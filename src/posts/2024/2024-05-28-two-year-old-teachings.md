My 2 year old daughter teaches me a lot. The older she gets, the more I realize this, and the more I've tuned in and listened.

When she says "Daddy, snuggle" as I'm putting her down for the night, it doesn't matter if the Celtics are playing... I get in bed and I snuggle until she is asleep. Sometimes I am too. Oh well.

I will do *anything* to help her succeed. I'll move mountains. I'll call in favors. Whatever she needs, she'll get. So why don't I do that for *myself*? Why will I not do whatever I can do to help me succeed at things I want to accomplish? I should look into that.

**Mind over matter**. V has 2 short parents, and in turn, is short herself. She was in the 0.1% for height at her 2 year checkup; after a growth spurt, she's up to the 1st percentile now. I joke that all the growth hormones are going straight to her brain, because she is smart as hell (and everyone notices). When she can't physically conquer an obstacle in front of her, I watch her think it through, then navigate it to the best of her ability. Or she'll come and speak full sentences to us to elicit our assistance. I used to be so self-conscious about my height, but watching her navigate life, it makes me realize what truly matters.

**Be joyful, make joy**. We are truly lucky; V is such a happy kid. I know grumpy kids, and she is not one of them. She's super funny, loves everything and everyone, and wants to include you in her activities ("hey pest control man, you wanna sit down and watch Bluey with my kid? She's asking for you."). Her joy is infectious, too. Her laugh is the best sound I've ever heard, and it makes me smile and laugh along with her. When she squeals with glee when someone chases her, it makes you want to chase her more. When she goes over to my wife, grabs her head, and gives her a dozen kisses on her head, it makes me remember what showing love is all about.

She's constantly teaching me about life, and I couldn't be happier to learn from her.
