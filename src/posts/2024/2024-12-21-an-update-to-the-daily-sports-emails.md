Back in June, I released the first version of [my Daily Sports Emails project](/daily-sports-email/). At the time, this only would send emails each day for MLB. This has now been updated, and [the project now also officially supports NBA and NFL games & teams](https://github.com/niclake/daily-sports-email). Hooray!

For NBA and NFL games, you'll need to get a SportsData.IO account, along with free trials to either the NBA or NFL APIs. It's super easy to do (and free!), and unlocks the ability to get these emails generated for you.

[Let me know what you think](/hello), if you have any questions, or run into any problems! And as always, if you enjoy this project, you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/niclake){:target="_blank"}.
