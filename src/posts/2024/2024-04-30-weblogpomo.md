i’ve decided to join in on Weblog Posting Month, or WeblogPoMo, for May 2024.

Blogging has always been an outlet for me. I’ve had aspirations of doing something more with it, and I would like to make writing something that I do more frequently.

[Robb Knight][robb] brought my attention to WeblogPoMo, and I thought it would be a great way for me to start flexing my writing muscle once again. It’ll be a little bit of a challenge, considering I’m leaving for vacation in less than two hours[^1], but I think it’ll be quite a bit of fun.

Here’s what [Anne, the individual who is organizing thing, has to say][anne]:

> What is it? Weblog Posting Month, 2024! If you use weblog.lol, or otherwise have a personal blog, you should absolutely participate in this month-long blog posting extravaganza!

Anne suggests that we choose some sort of guiding theme; mine is simply “write”. I’ve already got a ton of ideas that range from “how I Dad” to “what would I do if I could start college over?” to “here’s a short story about my D&D character”.

If you’d like to follow along with me & the community, you can follow along with the social hashtag `#WeblogPoMo2024`, [the @pomo account on Mastodon][pomo], or by [checking out the participants list][participants].

See ya on the other side. 👋🏻

[^1]: I really didn’t want to bring my laptop with me, but I’m going to do everything in my power to leave it in my bag and just use my phone or iPad to write and post all of these.
