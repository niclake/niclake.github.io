Being paralyzed sucks.

Certainly, physical paralysis falls into that above statement. I, however, am talking about mental paralysis, something I have far too much experience with.

I seem to experience mental paralysis whenever my plate gets **too full**. When I have nothing to do, I'm bored. When I have a small group of things I'd like to do, I can pick one or plan ways to get them all done.

But when there's a large number of things on my plate... I'm helpless. I become paralyzed. Fear of starting down the wrong path. Annoyance that projects X, Y, and Z will require a large amount of invested time to begin, and leave me little flexibility to do anything else. Frustration that I don't have more time to do it all. The list goes on.

Here's an incomplete list of things on my "Do Something, Stupid!" list:

- Work on my blog, both writing and the visual
- Work on my new EP
- Work on programming skills (Apple's new Swift language has jumped to the top of my list)
- Read
- Play through the dozen or so video games I own and have never beaten
- Work out
- Cook


Reading, cooking, playing video games... I can pick those up at any point and just roll with it. But blogging, recording, or programming... those are things where I get tunnel vision and will spend countless hours working on it. And I'm just afraid to even begin.

Anyone else have this issue? Any good solutions?
