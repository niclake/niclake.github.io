I am firmly of the mindset that everyone, regardless of gender, race, age, or occupation, should learn how to program.

Now, I'm not advocating that you should strive to spend hours upon countless hours stuck in front of a computer screen, hoping to come up with the next Facebook or something. (If you do, and this post was what inspired you, kickbacks will be appreciated.) Rather, I feel people should at least understand what it takes to make a computer program, and how complex yet simple it can be.

We want the future generations to be problem solvers, and I can think of no better way to develop those skills than to learn how to program. These skills can take many forms; you could create simple text-based applications using C (like I did my first semester as a computer science major (My Comp Sci I final application was an atrocity, spanning 97 pages. About 2/3 of it was just copy/pasted nonsense in order to accomplish what I want. My professor was PISSED when he accidentally printed it off 3 times. <a href="https://github.com/niclake/Portfolio/blob/master/C/D%26DProject.c" target="_blank">You can view the code here</a>; the cringe-worthy stuff starts on line 614.)), you could develop web sites and implement PHP and Javascript in your work (This is my day job now.) (because "real programmers" will yell at you and say that HTML is not programming), or you could pick up Objective-C or Swift and make applications for Macs, iPhones, and iPads.

Programming can easily help you develop people skills (This amuses me, because the reason I got out of computer science was thinking "well, I don't want to be stuck in a cubicle all day the rest of my life". A programmer who can't communicate with other people is just a person who can write code.) and figure out how people think. When you make an iPhone app, not only are you working to solve your issue, but you'll probably be tackling things like graphic design, functional design, human interaction, marketing, and technical support. Anyone can make an app, but it takes understanding of all of those above-mentioned things (and more) to create great apps.

With that being said, I've started my journey into the Swift programming language, and I've got a pretty decent idea for an application that I'll be shooting to release. I'm not going to get rich off of it, but I'm hoping that it helps me further develop my skills, and possibly set me up for future success.
