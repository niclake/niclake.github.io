For ages, I've been thinking about blogging again. I'm notoriously bad about it... I'll go for a week or two blogging with regularity, and then I'll go completely silent for weeks. Believe me, this isn't intentional; it just kinda happens. I get wrapped up in different projects, the sport of the season, a new video game, or other aspects of life, and just don't carve out enough time to actually write up a blog.

So... what's new in 6 months? Quite a bit, actually.

New roommate, since the old one graduated and moved away. This guy is here working an internship through the summer. Not really sure where I'll end up once this lease ends... staying in CF? Moving away? Who knows.

Still playing at church, but taking time away from playing guitar, since we have an influx of electric players right now. Playing bass and drums (DRUMS!!!) now. Played drums at the beginning of March for the first time in 8 years, when I tore a tendon in my wrist and had to leave the music ed program. Great feeling.

My newest EP is... still not started. It's named, the tracks are named, but the recording process just hasn't gotten off the ground yet. Need to do that.

I started a food blog. Yesterday, in fact. I cook all the time, love cooking, and am flabbergasted by all the people that say "but cooking is haaaaaard". No, it really isn't. Cooking is fun. Just like anything in life, you start by following the directions to the letter, but eventually you start branching out and adding this or that, and suddenly your recipes are all your own. My blog will have recipes, as well as tips & tricks I've learned over the nearly 2 years I've been living on my own. If you're curious, you can follow it over at <a href="http://thefoodweb.tumblr.com" target="_blank">http://thefoodweb.tumblr.com</a>.

I feel like I'm missing something important...

Oh yeah! I'm dating this nice lady named Becca, and she's super pretty. I met her this fall through a friend, and we started dating in January. If you follow my <a href="http://instagram.com/niclake" target="_blank">Instagram</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/niclake" target="_blank">Twitter</a> feeds, no doubt you've seen pictures or references to her popping up everywhere (sorry, not sorry). She's a chiropractic student down in the Quad Cities. She has a pretty swell taste in music. Her cat is the coolest cat I've ever met. She laughs at my jokes. She pushes me to be a better person, in many aspects. She's pretty cool, and I think I'm gonna keep her around for a while. (Sorry, ladies.)

I promise I'm going to try and be better about my blogging. I know there's a lot of people out there that enjoy it quite a bit. I used to try to keep a hard separation between my tech, my music, and my personal life, but I think that's all going to change. This is my blog, right? I can do what I want. So, you might see posts about this or that cool thing that happened, or about this new game I'm playing, or about music, or sports, or whatever. But hey, that's better than nothing, right?
