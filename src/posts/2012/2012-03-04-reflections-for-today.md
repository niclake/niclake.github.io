It doesn't matter what you did yesterday. And certainly, no one cares what's on tap for tomorrow.

The only thing that matters is the present. The only time is right now.

And the only work that you're going to get done is whatever the heck is in that pile, just waiting for you to tackle.

So stop reading. Stop trying to "find motivation" or "get focused". Just go do the damn work.
