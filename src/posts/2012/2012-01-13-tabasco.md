Distilled vinegar. Red pepper. Salt.

With three common ingredients, Edmund McIlhenny created Tabasco sauce, one of the finest condiments known to man. It's not just a hot sauce. It's not just a flavor enhancer. It's so much more than any single label could ever portray, and yet it's so simplistic.

Ed didn't go out and get the fanciest ingredients he could get his hands on, just to make his product “special”. He didn't add every spice he had in his kitchen either. Just vinegar, pepper, and salt, shaken well. And yet, it's one of the most versatile and powerful items that people have in their cupboards today. Pizza? Spice it up. Eggs? Variety time. Bloody Mary? Spicy Mary.

It seems that the latest trend is to over-complicate things. Cram as many features into X, and see what happens. This is true with so many aspects of life. High school kids that involve themselves with anything and everything possible. Companies that attempt to cram every last “modern tech” into their device. Guitarists attempt to fit a gazillion notes into a solo.

**Less is more, and more is a waste.** Don't burden yourself by including too much. Strip it to the basics, and let them shine on their own. If the basics aren't good enough, make them good enough, or change what you're doing.

Three ingredients, endless possibilities. So much more than hot.
