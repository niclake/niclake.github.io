In the hands of a surgeon, a sharp blade is used to make tiny incisions, allowing them to fix issues with minor scarring.

For an artist, the same blade can help them trim down their crafts, sharpen pencils, and more.

For a chef, it chops, slices, dices, minces, and trims.

For an adventurer, it cuts down vines and brush.

And for a desperate college student, it makes a decent (but dangerous) flathead screwdriver in a pinch.

The same knife could be used to do all of these jobs. It might not be the "best" tool, and some people might appreciate a more specialized tool,  (Imagine an adventurer wielding a scalpel instead of a macheteâ€¦) but they'd work for the most part.

What about a tool like Twitter? That's right, Twitter is a tool. It assists you in communicating with the world. You might not use it the same as the next guy, and you might have an entirely different purpose for using it in the first place, but it's still a tool.

When I first got Twitter, I thought it was a "mini-Facebook". I didn't use it. A year later, I realized that some of my techy friends were using it, so I fired it back up and used it as a way of communicating with them. Still like Facebook, but it was a niche for us. (I remember one time, I had Twitter linked up to my Facebook status messages, and my friend Shawn and I went to play 18 holes of golf. I live-tweeted our scores hole-by-hole. People were PISSED, and I lost about 10 Facebook followers that day.)

Then I met a slightly different community. <a href="http://twitter.com/patrickrhone" target="_blank">Patrick Rhone</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/shawnblanc" target="_blank">Shawn Blanc</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/gruber" target="_blank">John Gruber</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/cptnrandy" target="_blank">Randy Murray</a>. Guys that were using Twitter for far more than just saying hello or telling each other what they ate for dinner. (Though I admit, I do love seeing Instagram'd food pr0n cross my feed every now and again.) For them, it was productivity. It was getting sources, asking for help, bouncing questions off of one another, and so on.

People still ask me what I use Twitter for, and I can never give them a straight answer. But I can tell you what it's done for me. It's helped me meet some absolutely wonderful people. It's directly led to me getting 3 jobs, including my current gig as a writer for <a href="http://macgasm.net/" target="_blank">Macgasm</a>. (The others are my current IT job on campus, and my gig as a proofreader for <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a>) It's made me <a href="http://twitter.com/OverlandParker/status/102215859547807744" target="_blank">laugh</a> (a <a href="http://twitter.com/simonpegg/status/162032658480762880" target="_blank">whole</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/ismh/status/109807002825408512" target="_blank">bunch</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/davidcaolo/status/109658124067151872" target="_blank">actually</a>), and it's made me cry. It's helped me stay current with the news. It's <a href="http://twitter.com/patrickrhone/status/146968910871265280" target="_blank">inspired me</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/rands/status/88700240248569857" target="_blank">over</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/mgoldst/status/83363939244716033" target="_blank">over</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/cptnrandy/status/73726810470363136" target="_blank">again</a>. And, of course, it's helped me waste a crapload of time during boring classes. (That's what the internet was invented for, right?)

My Twitter isn't your Twitter. My tools aren't your tools. But that doesn't mean you should knock it before you try it.
