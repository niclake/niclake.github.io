I'm tired of arguing, fighting, debating, or poking fun of various technologies out there. (Not saying I'm going to stop. But bear with me for the sake of the post.)

Everyone will always have their opinions on what is better. Coke or Pepsi. Nutella or jelly. Toilet paper over or under. And through it all, we will agree to disagree. We will make games out of it. We'll poke fun at that one silly kid who only drinks Diet Mountain Dew (Seriously, the jokes are getting old. I love this stuff.), TP under people will be savages forever. And so on and so forth.

But when it comes down to technology… well, I'm at a loss for what to do.

I will constantly promote my pro-Apple beliefs to everyone. I will probably continue to bitch about how much I personally dislike using Windows machines, and scratch my head at those that love them. Android will always irritate the crap out of me.

But see, the thing is, I've found what works for me. iMac at home, an Air on the go, and my iPhone in my pocket. Various services that enable me to sync content seamlessly, so I can pick up any device and be productive.

Frustrating, isolated, and irritating are words that should never be used to describe personal computing technology. Easy, seamless, and comfort are. And the great thing is, those words mean different things for different people. Find what works for you, and use it.

The mission is the same: get your work done. But the journey & the tools… well, that's where the adventure lies.
