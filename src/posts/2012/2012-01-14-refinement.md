I remember the day I got my first guitar and amp. After figuring out what the knobs did on everything, I cranked it up as loud as I could (i.e. until my parents yelled at me), turned on the distortion, and figured out how to play the intro to “Crazy Train” and other various cheesy licks that assault your ears every time you walk into a Guitar Center. It sounded horrible, mostly due to my lack of technique, but to me, it sounded fantastic.

That was almost 10 years ago. Now, I rip out not only the intro to “Crazy Train”, but the verse and chorus lines as well. Still haven't figured out the solo yet, but I'm not exactly a metal guy, so I guess it's slightly understandable. Now instead of jabbing at ears with icepicks, I get people head banging and throwing up rock fists.

Whenever we first get involved with something new, we're rarely going to be great right away. New jobs, new instruments, new significant others, and so on. There's routinely a very steep curve as we acquire tons of information and ability in regards to the new topic at hand. This is your new boss' name. Here's how to play a pentatonic scale. Remember: she doesn't like it when you crack your knuckles.

However, we need to remember that knowledge is a curve that never peaks. Even if new knowledge is only acquired once a day, week, month, or year, there's always information and skills out there that you have yet to learn.

Therefore, never plateau. Never become content with where you're at with your skills and abilities. One of the most frustrating things in life is to watch someone with great potential in some area waste it away by being content. (Oddly enough, those people get “bored” quite often.) Instead, strive to refine your abilities every day. Challenge yourself to learn something new. If you can't, then challenge yourself to more fully understand something you've already learned. Get specific. Get technical. Get detailed. Never get down because of an apparent weakness or impurities in abilities, but rather get excited to figure out how to rectify those situations.

Why do something 50%, 75%, 99.9999%, when we're completely capable of giving it 100% of our effort? Strive to be the best you can, and the possibilities will be limitless.
