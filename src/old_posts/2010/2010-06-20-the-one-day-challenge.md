I lost internet last night.

![](images/Downloads.jpg)I was in the middle of doing some stuff, and all of a sudden my ISP decided to take a dump.  I was chatting with a few friends over Ventrillo (an app for voice chat online), and that stayed up… everything else went down and has stayed down.

By itself, this isn't a terrible thing.  It's late at night, nothing super vital was occurring, and I probably should get away from my computer a bit anyway.  But this, in conjunction with a comment another friend made earlier in the evening, really got me thinking.

My other friend said something along the lines of: "The internet has changed the social culture of a generation, possibly for the better."

For the better?  Eh... that's questionable.

Facebook, World of Warcraft, AIM/MSN, Twitter, Skype, Xbox Live/Playstation Network, texting, e-mail... these are all sites/programs/communication standards that are used by millions of people every day.  If we have the desire and the funds, we as Americans (and humans worldwide, to some degree) have the ability to stay in constant contact with one another.  Sick?  Chat with friends.  On the road?  Shoot someone a text.  Bored?  Fire up WoW and interact with people all over the world.  Got a meeting to put on?  Pull up Skype, and you could potentially do the meeting from your homes.

I love technology.  The exponential growth rate that I've gotten to witness over the past 10 years boggles my mind.  I have no doubt that at some point, new advances are going to leave me in the dust, and I'm going to be totally confused and lost, just like my parents were at one point.

But is technology good for social interaction?

To some degree, I'm one of the types of people that's consumed by technological interactions.  The ease of contact that I have with other people on a day-to-day basis is such a great thing (in my mind), and I honestly don't see how my parents, or the generations before them, survived without it.  I'm sitting here now, even in my dead zone, texting a friend of mine as I write this post and semi-read a book.  As a natural multi-tasker, things like this come easily for me.

But what about those that don't have as good a grasp on interaction as others?  There are people out there that do nothing but sit behind their computers all day long, playing games, browsing the web... basically, doing NOTHING, being lazy, and not interacting with other people except through a screen and a monitor.

You cannot interact with a computer screen the same way you interact with a human being.  This is the same as the whole "in person vs. over the phone" argument.  I remember that I used to hate talking to my ex on the phone, because it was so much more difficult to judge her mood/reactions by only hearing her voice (her parents always spied on her, so she had to remain relatively bland in all conversations).  Driving over to her house was a blessing for me, if nothing else because of the person-to-person contact that we could have (get your minds out of the gutters, kids).  This holds true when it comes to chatting/playing a game vs. hanging out/going out/whatever.  I would much rather go sit around a table at a bar, or go over to someone's house, than I would send text messages/IM's all night long.  Even the whole revolutionary concept of video chat, through programs like Skype... nope.  Sure, it works, but I prefer other methods.

So I'm proposing a challenge to myself, and I invite you to do it to.  I'm not an addict, but I do see plenty of places that I can improve, and so I'm going to give that a shot.

I'm on vacation next week, and so for one day during the week, I'm going totally non-tech.  No internet, no TV, no cell phone.  I can use my computer, in the capacity of doing things that a) aren't a game and b) aren't online.  This leaves me with writing... which I'm ok with.  I'll check my e-mail once in the morning, and if I receive a phone call from someone I'm allowed to call them back.  I'm also allowed to make phone calls, but only for the purpose of planning a meet-up.  Absolutely no texting.

Yeah, it's a lot of rules and clarifications... but I figure it'll get me out from behind my desk, and out doing things.  Even if a lot of the day is spent by myself, I can do other productive things, like practice guitar, go on a bike ride, read a book, etc.

Give it a shot.  Try this for yourself, and see how it works.

Also, on a not-side note... Happy Father's Day to all the dads out there, and especially to my pappy.  I wouldn't be where I am today without his kindness and generosity.  I love you, Dad. :-)
