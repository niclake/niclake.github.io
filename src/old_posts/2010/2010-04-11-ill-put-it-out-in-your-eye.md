There are some days where I can't get over how utterly stupid some people can be. This past week has been one of those "days". (To be fair, the past 8 or so years would qualify as one of those "days" where I'm disgusted by what I'm about to speak about, but I'm limiting it to recently, just because I can.)

The particular aspect of society I speak of today... is **smoking**. \*\*\*Be warned... if you are a smoker, I don't give a damn that I'm about to (potentially) offend you. My care cup is completely empty in that regard.\*\*\*

![](images/smoking-cigarette_18.jpg)I am utterly amazed that people continue this disgusting habit today, even though they know the consequences for their actions. Anyone that tries to pretend that there are not negative consequences to smoking is an even bigger idiot. People that say "well, cigarettes don't cause lung cancer, it's the tobacco..." No. Shut up. My argument might be technically flawed, but your logic is worse.

Most of this rant comes on the heels of watching one of my good friends destroy his life over the past... 2 years? I don't know exactly when he started. We'll call him D for the sake of his anonymity, though anyone who knows me and my friends probably knows who this is. Again, care cup = empty.

I met D during my 3rd year of college. He was a former high school athlete, running cross country and (I believe) playing baseball. Cool guy, and still one of my best friends to this day.  But somewhere along the lines, he picked up the habit. I'm not sure how, I'm not sure why, but he started smoking cigarettes. At first, it was a "well, I just smoke when I drink" sort of thing. Then it was a "well, I only have 2-3 a day". Now, the guy lives paycheck to paycheck (or so it seems) to finance his cigarettes and beer.

I need to back up a little bit here at this point. I'm not at all opposed to people doing whatever the hell they want with their lives, so long as it doesn't affect me. I have friends that are gay, bi, smoke weed, drink excessively, dabble in sexual promiscuity, speed, ditch class, skip work, are terrible boyfriends/girlfriends, etc. etc. While I don't necessarily see eye-to-eye with their decisions (and I will occasionally voice these differences, though 90% of the time it's in a non-confrontational way), I realize that it's not my life to live, and since it doesn't have anything to do with me, I don't care. Heck, I've even dabbled in a few negative activities at some point in my life, and it wouldn't be fair of me to judge.

That all changes when it comes to the matter of cigarettes. You see, _I'm allergic to cigarette smoke_. More specifically, I'm allergic to nicotine. Said allergy can be triggered by second-hand smoke. You know, the same kind of smoke that can give children lung cancer because their parents smoked indoors. That stuff.  Thus, if you smoke around me, you're directly affecting my health.  Seriously, if someone ever intentionally blows their cigarette smoke in my face, I will not hesitate to take that cigarette and put it out in your eye.  Or your nostril, if you're wearing glasses.

Ugh... I keep getting off on tangents, but... I'm really happy that Iowa (and other states) passed the law preventing people from smoking indoors in public places. For one, the odor of cigs are absolutely disgusting (to me), and it also means that I can enjoy my life as a college student by going to bars/restaurants and not having to worry about coming home reeking of smoke. (Seriously... people that used to smoke in restaurants... how disgusting is that? "Yes, I'll have the salmon, with broccoli florets, and could you please bring an ash tray with you?" Gross.) However, I can't go to the casino very much (probably a good thing), because they're still allowed to smoke indoors there. Over the winter, you may have read [about my escapades at the casino](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/this-is-probably-the-worst-life-lesson-for-me-to-learn/)... what I didn't mention was how I was miserable/stuffed up for 2 solid weeks afterwards. Anyway...

So D picked up the habit of smoking. Now he smokes regularly. I've heard about him smoking as many as 10 in a day, and as few as 2? 3? Something like that. I razz him every time we're hanging out that he shouldn't smoke. He knows I'm allergic, and yet he still lights up around me. 90% of the time he's respectful of the fact, and will keep his distance/smoke downwind of me. The other 10%, he's too drunk to care.

I remember one time, we were going to play a round of disc golf, and D asked me to stop at the booze store so he could pick up a pack. I laughed in his face and kept on driving. The last thing I will ever do is promote someone's smoking habit.

Anyway, last night just pushed things over the brink for me. I went to join D and a few of my other friends at a bar to chill/watch them drink (somehow I ended off paying for half a pitcher, but whatever). On the way back, D stopped and picked up a pack of cigarettes, since he'd just gotten paid and finally had money. He gets over to the house, and we're all sitting outside around a fire. About 10 minutes later, he comments "wait, where did my cigarettes go?" Somewhere along the journey, he'd lost his pack. Internally, I thought "good, maybe he won't smoke for a bit."

Wrong. D goes right back to the store and buys another pack. Another $6.50 (or whatever) down the drain.

(For the record... had I found the cigarettes, I would've thrown them away/in the fire. Call me a douche, but like I said, I'm not going to promote someone's smoking habit.)  (Oh, and no, I didn't find them.)

It's not that I'm trying to be a dick every time I tell him how stupid he's being. I'm really not. I tell my friends/family that they're stupid because I care about them, and thus care about their well-being. I could just shrug and say whatever, but that's not (in my eyes) something a good friend would do.

I like how some people make the association with women as "if she smokes, she pokes". Who cares? You know how professors sometimes reserve the right to drop you a whole letter grade if you don't do things right in class? That's how I am with people and cigarettes... my respect level for them takes a huge hit in the negative direction.

I've heard tons of excuses on why D (or others) won't give them up...

- They're good conversation starters.
- They help calm them down.
- They like the taste. (Seriously? No wonder you drink shit beer.)
- Helps them lose weight. (Obviously not...)
- And many others...

And I counter with...

- Go up and strike up a conversation about something other than "hey, got a light?"
- Take a deep breath.
- Chew some gum.
- Work out/eat less.
- And many others...

Does my dislike of people who smoke stem from being allergic? Perhaps. But I think more than that, it stems from the fact that smoking shows a blatant disrespect for one's well being. Sure, we're all gonna die someday, and you might get lucky and not get lung cancer. But by smoking, you're also looking like an idiot, and you're wasting your money. (Going off of what I know of cigs) If you smoke 3 packs every pay period, and those packs are $6.50, then that's $507 you're blowing every year.  _How the hell am I supposed to respect you, when you don't even respect yourself?_

I realize that people get addicted (or so they say... I could tick off numerous examples of people quitting cold turkey), but that's no excuse. You were dumb and started in the first place. Get help. Get the gum. Talk to a doctor. Throw your packs away. Stop wasting your money.  Take initiative and do something about it.

I'm not saying I'm perfect... I'm just saying that you (the smoker) are really freakin' stupid.
