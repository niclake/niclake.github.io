Facebook went down for 2.5 hours yesterday.  And people FREAKED.

It was actually quite amusing to witness.

People always assume I'm constantly on Facebook, simply because I routinely have my chat program open.  No, I'm not always on, but it's nice to hear from you for the first time in about 3 years, how are you?

Anyway...

For two and a half hours yesterday, the general populace of Generation Y had abso-fuckin'-loutely no clue what to do with themselves.  No one was able to stalk their friends.  People were incapable of instantly uploading their pictures of their evenings (which, in hindsight, probably saved them quite a bit of embarrassment).  Others weren't able to let everyone know that they were going to bed before they... well, went to bed.  \*gasp\*  The suffering!  The agony!

Can it.

Society nowadays is really starting to remind me of the Terminator or Matrix movies.  You know, where everyone becomes way too dependent on technology, and suddenly it takes over.  Instead, in our world, tech doesn't kill us, it just make us look like complete idiots when it decides that it wants to crap out on us.

I don't have my cell phone with me today, because I forgot to charge it for the past couple of days, so it's sitting home on my desk.  Shit... now I won't be able to be disruptive and disrespectful by checking my e-mail or texting people during class.  I hate my life!!!  OMG SOMEONE BRING ME MY PHONE!!!!!

(Yes, I do sometimes text during class... stay on topic here...)

Here, everyone, I would like to introduce you to 3 things that will make your Facebook-less lives a little more not-sucky.

Whether you're consuming adult beverages or not is up to you.  And look, Bill's going for the double whammy by reading a book at a social interaction!"\]![](images/23806_627356121523_38201890_36527782_5823776_n.jpg)\[/caption\]

I could go on with my post of telling American society how stupid their reactions were yesterday, but I would be typing for the remainder of my life if I did that.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go post my blog on the internet, then share the link with all of my Twitter and Facebook friends.  Hopefully no one texts me about the post between now and when I get back to my dorm, because oh crap, instant gratification and all that.
