Before I begin, I just have to say… there is absolutely nothing that I enjoy more than playing music with great musicians. It truly has the ability to change my entire outlook on life, and make a so-so day into a fantastic one. Sadly, I don't get to do that nearly enough.

Something about the music… it's just awesome when you've got like-minded people together doing things, and I'm sure that holds true for all walks of life. For me, music is one of the more important things in my life, so maybe that's why it affects me so much. When things get groovin', as my blog title puts so well, the music truly plays you and guides your hands/feet/air (if you're a wind player) beyond what you usually find yourself capable of.

Anyway.

Tonight's title will make a little more sense once you're done reading… suffice to say that it's what I feel I've been delivering to life in general lately.

If you've kept up with my blog at all, you probably know that I've struggled with a lot of different things over the course of the past 2 years. Depression, loneliness, female issues, dropping out of school, working, losing my job, living on my own, going back to school, struggling with classes, money, and many many more. I've tried not to let these things own me or change who I am as a person, but it's become difficult as more and more of them pile up. After a while, you just have to throw your hands up and say "time out!" or something… it really can be a huge burden.

I was reading [a post today on Lifehacker, one of my favorite web sites](http://lifehacker.com/5512791/declare-inbox-bankruptcy-as-often-as-necessary-save-yourself-a-lot-of-stress), that talks about "declaring inbox bankruptcy". I guess this is more applicable to those that use e-mail as their primary source of communication, and how they can easily be overwhelmed by a flooded inbox. It's basically the act of selecting all the unread e-mails in your inbox, BCCing everyone, and saying "sorry I haven't replied, I cleared my inbox. If it's important, please re-send your message.", sending that, and then clearing the e-mail forever. (Mom, this might be something for you to try…)

This week, I told myself that _I was declaring "life bankruptcy"_.

Why do I need to be stressed out about all this stuff? I've had "female issues" for 3 years… but nothing's changed, I'm just lingering on the past. My job is a piece of cake, it just requires me to sit there and study. I've lined up a job for this summer. I have a place to live (thanks parents). I'm back in school, and doing pretty good. I have money. Why do I need to let any of this crap get to me?

_Answer: I don't, and I'm not anymore_.

I took all my emotional difficulties, stuffed them into a little box in the corner of my mind, and said "if you're really that important, get back to me". Shut the box, shoved it out of my mind. Took a deep breath.

And I was at peace. It's been 3 years since I've been this peaceful about my life.

Now, yes, I realize that people have been telling me "get over it", "you'll be fine", blah blah blah forever. And you know what? You were right. Every single one of you. The problem was, I guess I just wasn't ready to let go of… whatever it was that was bothering me at that particular moment. You can't move on until you're good and ready, until you've hashed out every single scenario in your brain and beaten them to a pulp (or until they've knocked you senseless).

There's many more changes that I've made to my daily life that has helped get me "back on track". It's April, and I figured it was high time to do some spring cleaning, both in the physical and the technological sense. Today, I reorganized my entire room, getting things much much neater than it has been since... well, since I moved into this room. It's weird how moving things around and picking up a little bit can make this 14x10' room look so much bigger.

I've also done a whole bunch of "spring cleaning" things here on my Mac. I thought I'd share a few of them with you. (Note: most of these tips are universal, and can be used in all sorts of contexts. Some of these things might seem "stupid" to you, but I encourage you to try them and see how much nicer/calmer/more eye pleasing they make your computer.)

**\- Removed the toolbars from Mail and Adium (among others)**

Something as simple as this can make your computer feel a whole lot less cluttered. The toolbars on various apps are usually full of buttons and whatnot that you either a) don't use, 2) use so infrequently that you forget they're there, or III) don't even know what they do. For Adium (my AIM/MSN/Facebook chat program... Windows/Linux people, use Trillian or Pidgin) and Mail, this was blatantly apparent.

Ever since I started using my parent's PowerMac back in grade school, I've always been about being as fast as I possibly can when I'm working on things on the computer. Usually, this means utilizing keyboard shortcuts as much as possible. For example, when using Mail, I discovered very quickly that ⌘-Shift-D would send my message for me, as opposed to going up and clicking on "Send Mail" or something.

So why do you need the toolbars? Do you really use the stuff that's there?

I turned Adium's toolbar off, and later that day, I was looking for a particular person's message history. That used to be right in the toolbar, but now I had to go to the menu and hunt for it. Not a big deal... I use the history so infrequently, that I was fine spending 5 extra seconds looking around for something if it meant the eyesore and the general un-tidyness of my message window was gone.

This can be done with just about any app... for Macs, check the View menu and look for Show/Hide Toolbar. Not sure what it'd be on Windows, or if it's even got it.

**\- Organize your notes (in my case, stop using Stickies)**

I used to use the Mac program Stickies to jot down just about any note. I had a list of bands I was interested in finding out more about. A list of movies I'd like to watch. Blog ideas. The list of classes that I'm going to register for on Thursday. Phone numbers of people I need to call. Etc. The problem is, what happens if I'm not at my computer (it's an iMac, so it's kinda rooted to the desk), and I want to be able to access that data? For example, if I'm in the computer lab, or on my laptop on campus?

The solution? [A program called Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/). It's a handy little program that lets you take notes, be it big or small, and jot them down. You can title them, stick them in proper "notebooks", and give them tags and labels so you can reference back to them later. Right now, I have 3 notebooks: 1 for a couple drink recipes I'm holding on to, 1 for the 60ish food recipes I've got, and another one for a whole bunch of stuff (see the paragraph above) and general note taking.

The best part? Evernote is compatible with all the major operating systems (even the iPhone and iPad), and all your data is stored "in the cloud", or on a server somewhere that you can access from any computer. You can even just log onto the website without having to download any apps. It saved my ass just yesterday, when I needed to call somebody \*right now\* but couldn't remember their phone number... log onto the website, and 5 seconds later, I've got their number. Done and done.

**\- Organize your calendar... somehow**

I admire people that are able to keep their lives on track with a multitude of calendars. My mother is one of those. If I recall correctly, she's got 3 separate calendars with different things on them. The one in the kitchen with her evening activities, birthday, and doctors appointments. The one in the piano room, where she keeps the schedule of all her students and their lessons. And the third one up in her office, with... I actually don't know what's on that.

i can't do that. Not a chance.

I've tried many different solutions for trying to keep my calendar organized and available to me wherever I am. I've tried Google Calendar (meh), but I'm finally settled in with iCal and MobileMe. iCal is obviously great, and works just like I'd want it to. MobileMe synchronizes my data with "the cloud", allowing me to view my calendar (as well as my address book/contacts list) on any computer connected to the internet, synchronizing immediately when I add a new event/contact on any device.

If I'm on the go, and someone asks what I'm doing, I whip out my iPod Classic and check my schedule. If someone wants me to show up at a meeting, I can log in to my MobileMe site and pencil them in. It's convenient, and it works.

**\- Don't be afraid to "save for later"**

No, I'm not talking about money. I'm talking about things like articles that you're reading on the web, or blogs that you're interested in. Things like that.

When I'm at work at the computer lab, there will be times that I'm right in the middle of something, and the next person comes in to start their shift. If i'm reading the stuff on my laptop, that's probably the end of that, since I only really use that laptop while I'm at work. I shut it down, and it's forgotten.

[In comes Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) (thanks, Jason, for the heads up on this app). This is a nice web-based app that does one task, and does it well: when you want to save something to be read for later, you click on this bookmark (either in your menu or on your bookmarks bar), and it adds that link to your Instapaper "Unread" folder. At any point in the future, you can sit down, on that same computer or another one, and pull up those pages again. I used to do stuff like this with Evernote, but this is so much faster and more convenient. It's great when I've got a couple blog posts that I want to get to, and just don't have the time to \*right now\*.

Those are just 4 simple tips that I've got for you. Please, feel free to share your tips in the comments if you have some good ones. :-)

... It's funny, cause I think this is possibly one of the longest blog posts I've ever written... and yet I'm not done yet. I've got 2 more tips for you, and then I'll be done... kinda. Promise.

**1) Everyone has different sources of confidence**. They can be anything from a lucky charm to a routine to... whatever. What I suggest is: f**ind those, make note of them, and then _exploit the crap out of them_**.

For example: I had a test on Wednesday that I wasn't really confident about. It's in Financial Accounting. I hate accounting... or at least learning about it in this setting. It's kinda boring (ok, it's REALLY boring)... yeah, I've talked about this before. You know the drill.

Anyway, I was sitting in my room doing some last-minute review Wednesday morning, and for whatever reason, my head drifted back to the last time I was semi-confident about stuff that was going on. That time was over spring break, when I went to Des Moines and interviewed for that internship (you know, the one I was super pumped about and ended off getting). I realized that one of the things that gave me confidence was dressing up (more than usual) and going in there with some extra confidence.

So what did I do? Put on a nice shirt, a nice pair of jeans, my dress shoes, my watch, got all prim and proper, and went to take my test. And by God, I felt pretty damn confident that I was the best dressed person in that room.

I kid.

Seriously though, just doing that gave me that confidence boost that I needed to make my way through the test, not second-guess my answers, and pull off a B. I was pretty happy with that.

So whatever it is for you... find that "thing". Make use of it. Anything that inspires confidence in yourself is worth checking out, don't you think?

**2) Go back to your roots.**

Take an afternoon/evening to yourself. Get rid of everything non-essential. No Facebook. No TV. None of that junk. Grab a book and read a little. Go for a walk. As my mom was so nice in suggesting the other day, take time to listen to the silence.

Musicians have a saying that goes something like "sometimes the best note at a certain moment is complete silence" (or some variation). Jazz musicians like that a lot. When I'm playing guitar, I'm not a guy that likes to stand up and shred. Sure, it's fun sometimes, but I like to put soul and emotion into my playing... or as I say, I like to converse to you through the music. At certain points in the conversation, I need to stop and take a breath before I can continue.

Like right now.

And now.

I'm cheating a little bit. A friend gave me the eBook version of "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card (actually, he gave me the whole series of books... thanks, Danny). For the life of me, I can't figure out where I put my physical copies of those books, so having these is super nice. The past few nights, I've taken about 30-45 minutes at the end of my day to just sit and read a little bit. It's quite nice.

Did I say 2 things? Sorry, I lied. One more thing. Check out the site [Marc and Angel Hack Life](http://www.marcandangel.com/). It's a site I discovered the other day that has some fantastic thought-provoking entries, including the (ironically titled) "[25 Beautifully Illustrated Thought-Provoking Questions](http://www.marcandangel.com/2010/03/29/25-beautifully-illustrated-thought-provoking-questions/)". Do yourself a favor and read that.

Sorry that I've kept you for so long... if you've stuck around, thank you. Sometimes I just have to ramble, and tonight was one of those. But it was constructive.

Now get out there and kick some ass.
