Hello everyone.

As of right now, my brain is completely fried.  I've been reviewing for my finals over the past few days, and my head seriously hurts.  Here's what I've got:

1) Accounting.  Test Monday.  I need a 72/150 to maintain my grade.  That's right, less than 50% will allow me to get by.  I was freaking out about this test until I discovered this lovely tidbit Friday morning.  Now, not so much. 2) Humanities.  Test Tuesday.  Haven't studied yet.  I go to a study session in 2 hours where the professor tells us, word for word, the answers to the study guide we got.  I study those, and get A's on all the tests.  This is also a unit test, not a final per se.  Not worried about this class in the slightest. 3)  Decision Techniques.  Test Tuesday.  Studied for this class last night.  Could've moved the final to Wednesday, but I'd rather just get it over and done with.  Cheat sheets are made (we're allowed 3 front/back pages), and I'm ready to rock this test. 4) Business Programming.  Test Tuesday.  Another unit test, but this stuff is a bit more involved.  However, our teacher relented and is actually allowing us to do about half of our test as an actual coding project, rather than writing all of the code out by hand (which is a pain).  Going to study for that as soon as I finish this blog post.

I have been extremely cranky and irritable over these past few days.  It's really annoying, and I don't like it.  I want to take a nap, but I don't trust my alarm clocks anymore, so that's out.  Thankfully, I have the following things to help alleviate some of this stress:

1) My first live show in almost 4 years, and a night out with my cousin. 2)  Argyle socks (my first pair!) and a new hat 3) Chinese food and late night video game sessions with friends 4) 97gb of music on random 5) YouTube, especially their massive collection of live music

Below, I will link you some of my favorite YouTube videos that I'm loving.  Most will just be links, since I don't want to make loading my blog a chore.  All of these are must-watch videos, though, so do yourself a favor and check them out.

\---------- Random Musings ----------

I have a new business idea.  I'm going to start a distillery, and make a whiskey called Motivation.  Then I'm going to sell it in college towns during the weekend before finals.  It'll be the next Four Loko, I'm telling you.

I typed “music” into YouTube’s search, and it returned a bunch of Miley Cyrus videos. Is that like YouTube’s version of Rickrolling me?

Q: How many hipsters does it take to change a lightbulb?  A: It's a really obscure number.  You've probably never heard of it.
