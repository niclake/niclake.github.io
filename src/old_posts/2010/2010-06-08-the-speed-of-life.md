![](images/28-time-management.jpg)I've noticed that the older I get, the faster and faster life seems to be going.  And this bothers me a little bit.

No, I take that back... it bothers me a lot.

When we were young, life seemed to go by at a snail's pace.  A birthday would hit, and we're already looking forward to the awesome presents that we're gonna get next year.  Same went for Christmas.  A week until the next set of Saturday morning cartoons seemed like an absolute eternity.

Now?  Well, nowadays I wish that time seemed to go that slowly.

My first "holy crap" moment was at the end of this past semester.  As you know, I came back to college this year after taking some time off to work and get my life back on track.  The first semester, I couldn't wait to be done.  Classes were fun, but I was ready to move on and prove that I could do this after all.  The second semester, on the other hand, blazed past me faster than I could've ever imagined, and before I knew it, I was moving out of the dorms and getting ready to start this summer internship.  And now?  I'm starting my 4th week of the job, it's already June, and I just have no idea where all this time went.

When things are either going really great, or really badly, time just seems to slow down to a snail's pace.  I know, cause I've experienced both.  The best moments are etched into your memories forever, and the terrible moments seem to stretch out for an eternity.  But the "ok" moments?  The ones you feel a little "meh" about at the time?  ZOOOOOOM!  They just blow past you like a jet plane at full speed.

Normally, I don't think many people would be too upset by this.  I mean, if it's just a bland point of life, wouldn't you want to just have it pass you buy?

You'd think that.  And then you look back and go "holy \*&^#$, where did all this time go?!?"

I'm approaching age 24.  I'm not "old" by any stretch of the imagination, but if we play the odds, I'm probably over 1/4 of the way done with my life already.  And the bad part?  I don't feel like I've accomplished anything yet.  Just lately, this has really begun to bother me.

Obviously nothing ever goes as planned... if it did, I'd be a married percussion teacher living in Texas.  I'm nothing of the sort, and honestly, that's probably for the best.  I still have college, internships, relationships, and (more than likely) plenty of mistakes still in front of me.

But damnit, I'd really like if this whole "life" thing slowed down.  The last 6 months in particular, but the last 2-3 years in general, have passed me by so fast, that I haven't even had a chance to blink.  Maybe I still want to relieve my younger days.  Perhaps I'm just scared of getting old.  But someone needs to help me find the e-brake so I can slow this ride down a bit.

How about you?  Have you gone through a "SLOW DOWN!!!!" moment in life?  Did you manage to get control over it?
