Over at 20 Something Bloggers.net, they host semi-regular blog-swaps, as a way for people to share their thoughts with others, as well as get more readers.  I signed up for the most recent event, and now I'd like you to all welcome Kelly to TMPY.  We traded blogs for the day... you can find [my post on this topic here](http://morgendorf.blogspot.com/2010/04/blog-swap.html).

Hey guys! I’m Kelly from [morgendorf.blogspot.com](http://morgendorf.blogspot.com), and I’m here doing a guest entry on Nic’s page. Nic — thanks for welcoming me to your little spot on the internet. And hello readers!

The topic for this blog swap was:

“The Best Thing About Being a Blogger...”

...is the RELEASE. It’s being able to laugh with joy, cry with sorrow, vent with rage, sigh with exhaustion, yell with frustration, gleam with hope, and know that during it all there are people out there willing to experience it, and even more importantly, wanting to experience it.

I’ve tried journaling off and on since I was really young, but I never was completely satisfied with the results. I’d fill the pages up with my deepest inner thoughts, only to be denied a sense of release in the end because those pages were just for me. Yes, I know there’s an advantage to keeping some things secret, and I definitely do, but when it comes to day to day life I love being able to get it all out there and share it with others.

Blogging is now my release. Whether I’ve had a good day or an awful day, I know I can get some sort of relief from telling other people how it went, how I feel, and what comes next. I know that those who really do legitimately care will read it from their little corners of the world and nod, make connections, and possibly comments that in the end, make us all feel a lot less alone, and a lot more like a community of friends.

Without blogging, Nic wouldn’t have a place to write his [ninja adventures](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2010/04/12/life-of-the-modern-day-ninja-pt-3/), and [vent about his loathing for smoking](http://niclake13.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/ill-put-it-out-in-your-eye/). I wouldn’t have a place to reveal my latest obsessions (pigs and houses are the most recent) and open up about some of my daily struggles. A blog is an all-encompassing energy ball of our personality, and if we’re lucky, it will work like a magnet and draw in new friends with parallel (and sometimes perpindicular) lifestyles.

I have an idea: Let’s set up a day and time when all bloggers can pour themselves a glass of their drink of choice, and hold a collective, symbolic toast to everyone out there who turns to blogging for friendship, support, reassurance, a good time, and of course, release.

Cheers!!!

Peace,

Kelly
