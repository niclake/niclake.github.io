I start you out with a video, because I like this song.  Thus, you will watch it, and hopefully enjoy it as well.

Work's been a strange combination of awesome and brutal lately.  I was in Kansas City with Jake all last week, and had an absolute blast.  Royals/Twins game, great food all week (see picture for an example), a fairly easy work week, great conversations... I've never had a week of work that's been that enjoyable.  But the toll it takes on you... from the hotel beds, to the drive time, to the sheer number of hours that I've put in this summer.  There are numerous occasions where I just wish I had down time, where I could just sit and be bored.  And yet... I \*hate\* being bored.

It got me thinking... would I rather be bored, or stressed out?

Stress by itself isn't bad.  Homework, deadlines, taking care of kids, trying to think of what to write in your blog... these are all good kinds of stress.  They motivate you, make you work harder, make you a more productive person.  But when it all piles up on top of one another, that's when it's brutal.  5 papers to write, homework for 2 classes to do, significant others mad at you, parents upset with you, bloggers hating you for never posting (you all love me, right?  Right? ...), that's when it sucks.

But on the other hand, there's multiple levels of "boredom".  There's the "oh, I have nothing to do, so I'm just going to relax and read a book" level, and then there's "I've read every \*&^%in' book in this house, and if I don't do something, I'm going to go insane!!!!" level.

I hate boredom.  With a passion.  No matter what level it is, I don't like it.  Yeah, I appreciate down time, and I like being able to do things like read, play games, play guitar, or whatever.  But I would much rather be doing something, no matter how stressful, so long as it had some form of accomplishment tacked on at the end of it.  My work days now?  They can be insane.  But the sense of accomplishment I feel when I run our end-of-day script and log off the computer is quite rewarding.  It's kept me going all summer, so obviously there's something to it.

It's the same way with school.  I get antsy and become a bad student when I don't feel engaged in the class in some way.  When I have to write a paper a week?  Alright, let's do this.

![](images/stress.jpg)I think the people that claim to be "stressed out" all the time truly just have poor time management skills.  That's what it all comes down to, right?  "I don't have the time to deal with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_".  Buck up and make the time.  Prioritize.  What can wait, and what needs to get taken care of right now?  Figure that out, and then stick to it.

The other problem I think people have is the inability to compartmentalize.  If you've decided to put something off to deal with later, then deal with it later.  Don't think about it now.  Or things that have happened in the past... It's in the past, why are you still letting it get to you?

You know how I de-stress?  Hang out with friends.  Go on a walk.  Talk.  Bake brownies.  Basically, exactly what I did last night.  Don't even think about stuff you have no control over.  What's the point?

Live in the moment.  Love what you have, and what's around you.  Don't sweat the small stuff.  There's a reason quotes like those have survived for generations, don't ya think?
