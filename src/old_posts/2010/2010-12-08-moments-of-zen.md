![](http://media.yayart.com/media/art/generated/1660_618x618.jpg?_=1lt9El)This past Sunday, I filled in on guitar at the Waterloo campus of [Prairie Lakes Church](http://www.prairielakeschurch.org/default.aspx).  None of the songs we played were new to me, per se, but the arrangements definitely were different than I was used to.  I was a bit nervous going in...  This was my first time playing since I bombed an audition (which ended off not being a big deal, but it was still frustrating for me), I didn't have much time to learn the songs, and I hadn't played guitar in over a week (stupid school/finals).  Needless to say, I was worrying a little bit about how I was going to play.

As soon as the first song started, though, I was lost in the music.  This church uses in-ear monitors, which I haven't used since back when I played with [Crossed](http://getcrossed.com/index.php) (routinely I'm used to using wedges, or on-stage speakers).  I always tend to set my levels to sound almost like a recording mix; everything should blend together nicely, and stand out when it's supposed to.  It's almost hypnotic.  You'd think it'd be similar to when you play along with a CD or something, but it's not.  You're completely involved in the music, yet you feel completely separated from it.  The painfully loud click track disappeared.  Individual notes were nonexistent, for the most part.

And then, suddenly, the bass player dropped down on his 5-string and boomed out a C# that seemed to shake me to the core.  The next thing I know, I hear every note the synth player was holding out, every strum on the acoustic, and the pings and pops of the drum kit.  Time didn't slow down, but it was almost as if my ears and brain were processing every input at hyper-speed.  Probably one of the most incredible moments I've ever experienced.  It was, as some have explained it, a **_true moment of zen_**.

I actually had another one of those on Monday afternoon.  I laid down to take a brief nap, had some pretty vivid and realistic dreams, and then woke up completely refreshed, thinking I'd been asleep for a few hours.  In reality, I'd only been out for 15 minutes.

Whoh.

Have you ever had zen moments such as this, either accidentally or on purpose?  What were they like for you?
