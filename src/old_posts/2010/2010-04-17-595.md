So, for those that have somehow missed it... I'm currently up in Minnesota with my friends Bryce and Zeke, and yesterday we went to the Twins/Royals game at Target Field.  Absolutely amazing stadium... if you're a fan of baseball, do yourself a favor and go to the stadium.  Just don't spill the chili dogs all over your white jacket.

![](images/joe-mauer.jpg)However, after the game, it was late, we were tired, and we're 3 college guys stuck in a car.  Somehow we got talking about baseball analogies for sex and relationships.

Everyone knows about 1st/2nd/3rd/home, but what about the actual positions, or the statistical terms of baseball?  We've totally got that covered.  (We actually sat at a Perkins writing all of these down, while Bryce got stared at by a couple 17 year old girls.  Yeah buddy...)

Anyway... this is your last warning.  If you don't find the humor of college males funny, I'd advise closing this window now.  :-P

**Walk** - A drunk make-out.

**Hit by pitch** - That sore on her mouth? Yeah, that was herpes.

**Pick-off** - She's just not that into you.

**Balk** - Mixed Signals.

**Swinging strikeout** - You at least got in a word edgewise before she shut you down.

**Called strikeout** \- Rejected before you even took the bat off your shoulder.

**Batting average** - Your luck with the ladies.

**ERA** - Her slut-o-meter. The higher it is, the more number of guys that have touch home plate.

**VAR (Value Over Replacement)** - Enough said.

**1st base coach** - The reserved best friend. ex. "Dude, you could totally steal second base right now..."

**3rd base coach** - The over-eager best friend. ex. "You're almost there! Go home! Go home!"

**Hitting coach** - The person that tells you to grow a pair, get off the bench, and get in the cage. ex. "You'll never get a hit if you don't even pick up the bat!"

**Pitching coach** - The girl's best friend. Tells her what pitches she needs to throw you.

**Bat boy** - Too busy playing with the wood to get on the field.

**Collegiate athlete** - Still too busy playing with metal bats.

**Starting pitcher** - The girl you take to the party, but she gets too hammered and passes out.

**Relief pitcher** - The girl that steps in and takes over once the starter gets pulled.

**Save** - You end off getting some action from the relief pitcher.

**Blown save** - ... but she's so drunk that she throws up all over you in the process.

**Pinch runner** - After you get on first, you realize she's not for you, so you pawn her off on some other guy.

**Foul ball** - You spilled the girl's drink.

**Bunt** - You would. Get some stones and swing the bat.

**Stolen base** - Fooling around with another girl behind the pitcher's back.

**Stealing home** - One word: roofies.

**Error** - Three words: better self control.

**Sacrifice hit** - Taking one for the team on a double date.

**Fielder's choice** - Your friends tell you which chick to hit on after you get hammered.

**1st baseman** - Your best friend. He tries to stop you from going past first base in the wrong situations.

**3rd baseman** - The horny friend. Playing the hot corner like it's his job, always diving to snag as much action as he can.

**Outfielders** - Your friends that listen when you are having relationship issues. ex. "I tried for a double with her last night, but I ended off just flying out."

**Middle infielders (2B/SS)** - The sexual deviants of all your friends. They like to range in all the holes, and are always on the lookout to turn the double play.

**Ground rule double** - "Oh wait, we're supposed to be babysitting!"

**Catcher** - Her dad. You have 2 options... run him the hell over, or slide in and avoid his tag. Otherwise, you're never making it home.

And last but not least... **World Series ring** - Congratulations. Now pay up.
