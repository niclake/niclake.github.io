Today is Sunday, June 1st, 2014. Today is the beginning of a new adventure.

As I browsed through Twitter yesterday, I saw <a href="http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/10-years/" target="_blank">David Kadavy post about how he had been blogging for 10 years</a>, and talked about how his life had transformed from then until now. It was a cool experience, and it made me wish I'd kept better track of some of my old blogs.

... on second thought, no. Those were full of angst and hormones. I'm glad those have disappeared into the nether of the internet.

I'm at a transition stage of my life right now. I'm dating a great gal, and things are pretty serious. I just took a new job 2 weeks ago as a programmer/web developer, and I'm loving it. I'm working on a new EP. I'm about to get new roommates. For the first time in a very long time, I am happy with life.

However, there's still an itch I need to scratch. I'm an artist at heart, and creation is a big thing for me. I got to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEloqGP7Qr0" target="_blank">build a "guitar" tonight a la Jack White</a>. I've had an urge to redo my blog. I'm working on my newest <a href="http://themusicplaysyou.com" target="_blank">The Music Plays You</a> EP. I'd like to get more into web and software development, making apps or just updating my blog.

So, I'm hitting the reset button. As of today, I'm rocking a brand new install of WordPress, a blank theme, and a goal; I want to still be here in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years. I want to look back on this site and have a log of everything that I've done, everywhere that I've been, and to see how I've accomplished all my goals along the way.

Care to join me?
