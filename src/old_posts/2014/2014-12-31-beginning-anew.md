Tomorrow is January 1st, 2015. My evening will usher in the new year with minimal outward fanfare; R and I are staying in, making dinner, watching a few movies, and enjoying some peace and quiet. I've now got 4 days to relax, recharge, and get focused on the next 365 days.

2014 was an interesting year. I fell short of practically every goal I set (absolutely crushed the 25 new recipes made, though... pretty sure we topped 40), but it was far from a bad year. I started dating a lovely woman, and we are now happily engaged to be married in March of next year. I dropped 12 lbs. I got a new job, and I no longer hate waking up to go to work in the morning. I acquired a new motor carriage after the last one's suspension gave out. I made the switch to being a PC gamer.

Above all else, I developed a sense of patience. For those who know me, this hasn't really existed in my repertoire previously. However, after considerable practice and (ironically) patience, I seem to have developed the habit. And I can't tell you how happy that makes me.

Also, if you've read the blog before, you're thinking "hey, this looks different." And you're right. I decided to switch off of WordPress and onto Tumblr. I spent far too much time tweaking the theme rather than actually writing (something <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/" target="_blank">Patrick Rhone</a> would chide me about, probably), and decided enough is enough. I got all the archives moved over (sorry, Twitter followers... that spam was a bit much), and while things may look a tad broken, all the content is there. Huzzah.

So, for those that are interested in that sort of thing... my 2015 resolutions!

- **Get under 160lbs.** Starting weight: 172.2 lbs.
- **Release another album.** It's been nearly 2 years since <a href="http://themusicplaysyou.com" target="_blank">Sailing</a> was released. And I have SO MANY ideas.
- **Read more. Write more.**
- **Save money.** With an imminent relocation once R graduates, and plenty of student loan debt, I need to start putting money aside for things.
- **Spend more time disconnected.** We just spent 9 days on vacation in North Carolina. While I still had my phone and used it, my screen time was drastically reduced, and I felt awesome because of it.


There might be a few others that join this list at some point, but that's what I can think of right now.

I hope all of you have a very happy New Year. Start it off right. Always work towards being a better version of yourself. Love each other. Dream big. The future starts now.
