I've spent the past few months telling myself to update my blog, and a couple days the past few weeks actually doing it. I installed a blank theme, and started editing it from scratch, with the goal of "make it look nicer than it used to".

Well, if you're reading this on the site, you'll realize that things look fairly similar to what they used to look like. In fact, you might notice some things that you think look worse, like I do. As I started updating things, I'd pull samples from my old layout because I liked how they worked. Lo and behold, I'm sitting with things almost identical now.

Everything we do in life can have a learning experience attached to it, if we look hard enough. "Don't open the beer can that dropped on the floor", "Charge your laptop before you go to a busy coffee shop", or "Look both ways before you cross the street" are all great pieces of advice, but somewhere along the way, someone learned those lessons the hard way.

I have a tendency to set extremely broad goals. Here's my to-do list right now:

- <a href="http://themusicplaysyou.com" target="_blank">Finish my 2nd EP</a>.
- Record a side project idea I have.
- Be a good boyfriend & support my lovely girlfriend as she takes Pt 2 of National Boards so she can be a kick-ass doctor.
- Cook a bunch of stuff so I have leftovers next week.
- Read more.
- Write my novel idea I've been sitting on for 2 years.
- Finish updating my blog.


All of these make sense, and are great end goals. But without the steps in between, they're not very attainable.

I feel that's a place where a lot of millennials struggle. Everyone has taught us to set goals throughout our life, and to reach as far as our dreams will go. But very few people teach about the stepping stones. No one climbed Everest without first tackling smaller mountains first (Ok, I'm sure SOMEONE did, but you get the point).

We roll before we crawl, crawl before we stand, stand before we walk, and walk before we run. Don't be discouraged when you can't get off your back and sprint right away. Things take time to achieve. Set those intermediate milestones for yourself, and watch your spirits soar as they start getting checked off one by one. (So, for example, my EP list idea could look like: sketch out/record more song ideas, get all keys & basses recorded for each song, go and record all drums and guitars for each song, mix/master each song, release EP. And even then, some of those could be chopped down even more.)
