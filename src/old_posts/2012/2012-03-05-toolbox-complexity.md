Society is all about having the latest and greatest toys. This past weekend, the hype was around <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/canon-eos-5d-mark-iii-dslr-announced-2012-3" target="_blank">Canon's new 5D MkIII camera</a>. An absolute beast of a camera, and any professional or hobbyist's dream. But for amateurs like myself… why the heck am I drooling over it? So many features that I just plain don't need, that might get used once or twice.

I'm totally at fault of wanting the best stuff when it comes to my guitar gear. I've probably dropped a few thousand dollars <a href="http://blog.niclake.com/gear/" target="_blank">on my pedalboard</a> over time (though a lot of it was trading up). Do I **NEED** all of it? No way. Is it nice to have? Absolutely. Does it make gigging a bit complicated when it comes to figuring out a specific sound for each song? You know it.

The other day, I put together a small pedalboard. One overdrive, one simple delay pedal, and a tuner. I couldn't hide behind any effects, I just had to play. And play I did. It was one of the best sets I've had in a long time. Everything sounded fantastic.

Movies are the same way. We as a society have been entranced by Michael Bay-esque films lately. Explosions, visual effects, and so on. You know why "The Matrix" was so good? Because it had a story behind it, and the visual effects were only there to accentuate. You know why "Transformers" sucked so bad? Because it was just an opportunity for the studio to play with new toys.

<a href="http://patrickrhone.com/" target="_blank">My friend Patrick</a> is another great example of being simple. Not only does he run <a href="http://minimalmac.com/" target="_blank">a site based off of minimalist computing</a>, but he also writes books. His latest book wasn't penned on some fancy desktop or some shiny new laptop. <a href="http://www.enoughbook.com/about-writing-enough/" target="_blank">He just used his iPad and iPhone</a>. No USB keyboards, just the on-screen interface. Some would argue that the iPad is just a fancy toy. Patrick claims otherwise, and proves it by utilizing it as a powerful tool. It caters to his writing style, and (I figure) allows him to really think about what he writes as he writes it, rather than blazing along at 100+ words per minute.

So today, I challenge you to empty your toolbox. Completely. Put everything to the side, and then only put back the essentials, the things you ABSOLUTELY need, and only when you actually use them. All the rest are just gadgets, or the occasional useful tool that just takes up space otherwise. Your dock, your phone's home screen, your daily work environment, your toys and passions… Nothing is off limits.

Own the tools. Don't let them own you.
