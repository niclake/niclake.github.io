The greatest gift that you could ever give to another is the gift of knowledge.

However, drilling facts into one's brain is simply a terrible method of transferring knowledge, and one that I wish schools would work on distancing themselves from. I can tell a child that 2 times 2 equals 4, but do they understand the fundamental concepts behind it, or do they know how to regurgitate a desired answer back to me? No.

No, the best feeling is then explaining the concept of multiplication, then quizzing the student with a previously unasked equation, and having them return the correct answer. When one can take a learned concept and apply their understanding of it, then it is knowledge.

Telling me that the gift of knowledge isn't great is just stupid. We seek out knowledge every day, in every aspect of our lives. *"If I make this product, will people buy it?" "How much longer until I reach my destination?" "Why is my boss such an asshole?" "I wonder how much I can drink before I throw up."*

Unfortunately, the act of imparting knowledge onto another person (depending on the subject) can be an arduous journey. Mentors die. Classes end. Time is finite, and ultimately our master. We can choose how we spend our time, but there's only so much of it to go around.

And therefore, in my mind, the best gift for imparting knowledge onto another individual is something that never dies, that can be revisited as frequently as desired, and can be tackled at whatever rate of speed that you wish.

And that gift, my friends, is a book.
