Today marked the end of an era for me. At 4:24pm, I walked out of my last final at the University of Northern Iowa, never to set foot in school again as a student. (I hope.)

This entire semester has been a blur, with both good, bad, and bittersweet memories cropping up as I think back.

I've made friends with people that I never thought I could or would be friends with, and lost old friends because I now have these new friends. (I mean, really? Can't we all just get along?)

I actually spoke to a girl who I'd spent the better part of a year poking fun at for various, completely immature reasons. We've now been dating for over 3 months, and she makes me tremendously happy. (No, I won't explain what these things are. Suffice to say, if I'd been her, I wouldn't have given me the time of day after the things I said. I'm extremely lucky that she gave me the opportunity, because she truly is wonderful, and I'm very thankful to have her in my life.)

I took my first spring break trip since I got into college, going to Chicago with the lady and some friends, and had an absolutely wonderful time, even though we watch an attempted mugging in the subway. However, the trip made me realize that living in Chicago, while potentially fun, is not something I really want to do at this time.

I took my last final, wrote my last paper, and gave my last presentation as a student. No potential for bittersweetness here. That's just awesome.

I went to an interview in Des Moines on Tuesday. It went really well, and I'm hoping I get it. However, I managed to make my car overheat quite badly, which is just adding to all the issues my car has had since I acquired it.

As such, I may be getting a new(er) car. This is sweet, except I hadn't planned on doing so for a while, so funds are tight.

I have my internship lined up again for the 3rd summer, but I don't want to work it.

I want to start working at a full-time job somewhere, but I haven't gotten one yet.

I had to say goodbye to the lady today, as she left for home for the summer. She's 2 hours away, and since I don't have any idea where I'm working, I don't know how much I'll get to see her. However, she said a couple things today that made me really, really happy, and I've dealt with distance before. So, I'll be ok.

I've not gotten to say goodbye to a few people that I really care about, and I've had way too much interaction with some people that I could really care less if I talk to again.

This upcoming summer will be far more different than any I've experienced to this point in my life. Nothing is prepared or laid out for me. Everything is still in flux. I'm extremely nervous and excited about the prospect of starting something new, but still struggling to hold on to a few things that are old, known and comfortable to me.

But it's time to let go. Time to move forward. After 25 years, I'm finally striking out on my own. And it feels good, no bitterness about it.
