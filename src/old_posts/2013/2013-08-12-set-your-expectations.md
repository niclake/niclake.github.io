For those of you that don't follow me on any form of social media, yesterday was 6 months since my mother lost her battle with cancer. I've spent that time being the strong one for my dad, moving home (and then into another place in town), changing jobs, and a bunch of other stuff.

I decided earlier in the week that I was going to bypass the VEDA (Vlog Every Day in August) topic for yesterday (which was "show us your baby pictures"), and instead do a tribute to my mother. It seemed like the right thing to do. But as the day grew closer and closer, I realized that I was anxious, nervous, and kinda scared about sitting down and recording.

By Thursday, I had convinced myself "yep, Sunday is going to suck". I started warning people about my impending grumpiness. I didn't make any plans, specifically so I could just sit at home and mope my myself.

Saturday night, a friend of mine gave me a push. She doesn't know me all that well, but I know she could sense my hesitation about recording it. There was no demanding or coercing, but more of a "hey, go do this now while you think you can".

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qZaqQKquGs" target="_blank">And I did.</a> And it turned out pretty well. And it lifted a huge weight off of my shoulders. Sunday actually turned out to be a pretty good day, full of far more smiles than I expected.

I took one very important thing away from this... I need to stop setting low expectations for things. "I'm going to be grumpy and sad today, because of reasons.", "Today is going to be so boring at work." and so on. I need to reach higher and make this a life worth living.

p.s. Thank you to everyone for the kind words on the video yesterday, and for all the support over the past few months. And sorry if I've been a grump. Mom never would've wanted that out of me or my dad. So I'm doing my best to fix it.
