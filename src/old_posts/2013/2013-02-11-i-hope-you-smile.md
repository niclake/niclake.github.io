63 years and 1 month of life. Nearly 32 years of marriage to my father. Just shy of 26 years of being a mother. 9 years of suffering from multiple sclerosis, and a few months going toe to toe with cancer. My mother lived a full, successful, and rewarding life, filled with plenty of ups and downs. I could not have asked for a better role model, mother, and friend. As of Feb. 11, 2013, she is finally at peace.

I firmly believe that <a href="http://blog.niclake.com/2013/01/fuck-cancer/" target="_blank">every person on this planet has a purpose and a mission</a>. They will touch the lives of people and make a lasting impact on the world. It's been a few hours since my mother passed, and she's STILL taking me to school, even if it is indirectly.

1. I've received a tremendous amount of support from family and friends. A wonderful gent has offered to drive 4 hours to buy me a drink. Another person I've barely spoken to sent me a great message of encouragement. I'll be honest, some of these are coming from way out of left field. Lots of people I haven't talked to in a long, long time. And that's sad. **I need to be better about staying connected with my friends.** And not just "here's a Facebook message" or "here's a tweet" connected.
2. I feel guilty about smiling right now. I had a couple of friends send me funny images to cheer me up. And I laughed really hardâ€¦ and then immediately felt guilty for it. And that's stupid. **I'm not honoring my mom any less by being in a morbid funk.** If she was here, she'd tell me to stop pouting or a little bird will come and land on my lip.
3. I have a feeling "your mom" jokes won't be funny for quite a while.
4. Every negative emotion that I feel right now stems from selfishness. My birthday is Wednesday, which also coincides with the release of my first album. Valentine's Day is Thursday. May 1 would've been my parent's 32nd wedding anniversary. My mom never got to see me get married, and will never get to spoil the crap out of her grandchildren. I'm not mad at her, I'm just sad knowing that there will be one less person here on Earth watching me accomplish (hopefully) great things.
5. I'm scheduled to serve at church this weekend as a musician. I can see no better tribute to a great woman who dedicated her life to teaching music, both to me and to many others who came through her studio. Maybe I'm nuts, but it's a foothold on normalcy that I know would help me cope.

Got a great text as I was writing this: "Feel better when you can, and not a minute sooner." So many people feel like they have to put a timetable on their mourning. Realistically, this will hurt for years to come.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSeiG6qMhaI" target="_blank">Of Mice & Men's "Second & Sebring"</a> has been the ringtone for my mom for a while now. As of tonight, the lyrics have a much greater meaning to me.

> I believe it's time for me to be famous and out of place.
> I believe it's time for me to move forward when I break through.
>
> This time I'll make you proud to see me over, come on daylight.
> Proud of, who you raised.
> Your shelter, your peacefulness.
>
> So this time I'll make you proud.
>
> Proud of who you raised up.
> You know that I will always be here til' the end.
>
> Come back so I can say thank you for this,
> home cooked meals and a place to rest
> my troubled head when you're away,
> I've passed the test, I've earned an A,
> not just in school, but in life,
> you'll always be right by my side.
> To help me show, hope to all,
> that are lost and sick in this dying world.
> I'll use the love you left behind,
> I'll change their minds, I'll change their minds.
>
> I hope you smile when you look down on me.
> I hope you smile.
>
> This can't, we won't know.
> I hope that I make you proud.
>
> This is not what it is, only baby scars.
> I need your love, like a boy needs his mother's side.

Goodbye, Mom. You are gone, but never, ever forgotten. I love you.
