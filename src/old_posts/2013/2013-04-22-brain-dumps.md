As an artist and an introvert, I find that I have a lot of things on my mind. A lot. All the time. And it's frustrating.

One thing I've discovered recently is how different artistic endeavors can get in the way of one another. Prime example: I was in the middle of a book the other day, and I couldn't get a musical jingle out of my head. I'm on a self-imposed break from recording, but I knew that if I didn't put the idea I had down, it would drive me nuts.

It's similar to when you get that random, horrible song stuck in your head. You either need to go look it up on YouTube, or sing it as loudly as possible, right? If you don't, it's going to distract you for days.

Brain dumps are healthy for you. Being able to focus on the moment at hand and not dwell on something else is key for us to be able to get through our lives. When you're not distracted by other things. And this doesn't just apply to artistic outlets. Frustrated with something? Jot it down. talk about it. Meditate on it. Concentrate on it fully for a few minutes, get it off your chest, and then stop letting it bother you. Like this post, which I've been thinking about for over a week now.
