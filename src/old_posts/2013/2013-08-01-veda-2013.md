So those of you that have known me for a while might remember that I participated in something called VEDA, or Vlog Every Day in August, for the last two years. You *MIGHT* not remember, simply because I didn't make it very far... I think I got a week into it one year and 11 days the 2nd.

Anyway, I'm going to be giving it a shot again this year. Fun people + fun topics + willingly making a fool out of myself on video? Yeah, I'm all about that. (I totally twerked in my first video. Whoops.) Plus, I am visiting a couple of VEDA participants in a couple weeks in Chicago, and figured I should get in on the fun again.

You'll be able to follow all the fun <a href="http://youtube.com/niclake13" target="_blank">over on my YouTube page</a>. And most of the people commenting will be participants themselves, so you can always go watch their videos as well.

Here's to a great month.
