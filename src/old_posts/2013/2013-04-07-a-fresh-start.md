Over the past week, I've had the opportunity to sit at home and contemplate on my life. I've talked previously about how I miss letting my artistic side out, and how much better I feel when I do… and yet, I neglect all of those activities so often. Reading. Writing. Making music. So that's just one of the things that's going to be changing here in the coming days and weeks.

Perhaps I should back up a bit and recap everything that's happened.

For those that either don't converse with me frequently, or those that are just that far out of the loop… <a href="http://blog.niclake.com/2013/01/fuck-cancer/" target="_blank">my mom was diagnosed with cancer in January</a>, and <a href="http://blog.niclake.com/2013/02/i-hope-you-smile/" target="_blank">lost her battle just over a month later</a>. I was working in Cedar Rapids, IA, but moved back home to Cedar Falls (an hour drive) to be closer to my dad and to take a new job as a software developer (something I never thought I'd be doing). I'm also waking up stupid early tomorrow morning so I can start a 10-week fitness program before going to said new job.

On my birthday in February (2 days after my mother passed, actually), <a href="http://themusicplaysyou.com" target="_blank">I released my first EP, Sailing</a>. It's a bunch of down-tempo, instrumental ambient music. Maybe it's not your thing, but I'm pretty proud of it, and would love to have you check it out.

I graduated last May. I've been single for almost a year now. I've quit a high-paying job because of the stress. <a href="http://blog.niclake.com/2012/08/life-lemons/" target="_blank">I've handed out lemons to strangers</a>. I've learned how to make some of the best barbecue that you'll ever eat in your life (seriously). I've held off re-installing World of Warcraft for a long, long time.

So yeah. Life is changing, and I'm going to get behind the wheel and steer it a little. Tired of flapping in the breeze and wandering aimlessly. Here's the short list of things right now:

- New job
- Working out 5x a week (hopefully dropping 20 lbs.)
- More blogging… I'm not setting an amount, but I'll be writing more.
- More reading.
- More music making.

I don't have comments on my blog (spammers and trolls, yay!), but you can certainly <a href="http://twitter.com/niclake" target="_blank">tweet me</a> or <a href="mailto:hello@niclake.com" target="_blank">email me</a>. I'd be happy to respond or chat about stuff.
