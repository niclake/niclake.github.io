It is currently the evening of Sunday, Jan. 13. I just got back from visiting my mother, who has been at the University of Iowa hospitals over the course of the last month, being treated for a stomach blockage that prevented her from eating. After undergoing surgery, it was discovered that she has end-stage stomach cancer that has metastasized. It could be 3 weeks, 6 months… they don't know. It all depends on how aggressive the cancer is and where it spreads to next.

My mother was given the opportunity to pursue her dreams shortly before I was born, and she made the most of it. For as long as I can remember, she has been a stay-at-home mom and a piano teacher. I recall one semester when she had as many as 44 students; I've known her to have as few as a dozen. She excelled and thrived teaching young and/or beginning students the basics, and building them up as far as they wanted to go.

When I was 4 1/2, I apparently made the comment that I wanted to learn piano, and my mom began teaching me. Whether it was because of my talent or just because we needed additional perspective, I started taking lessons from another local teacher. This was in addition to the countless hours I practiced every morning before school and on the weekends. I eventually "graduated" from my first teacher, and started taking lessons from a university professor at a school 30 minutes away. Mom would get up, supervise my practicing for an hour and a half to 2 hours every morning before school, and then once a week would stop teaching early in the afternoon so she could drive me to my lessons.

I resented it. Truth be told, there was nothing I disliked more when I was in junior high and high school than waking up early, practicing, and going to my lessons. I still remember how I was always crossing my fingers and hoping that my teacher would forget (he did once) or get busy and be unable to have my lesson. Mom and I played games with the clocks and timers in the house; I would try my hardest to cut time off of my practicing, and she would diligently make sure that I was in front of the piano for the entire time. We argued and squabbled, and our relationship was strained because of it. I was restricted in athletics, because she wanted to protect my hands from damage. When my arm started to give out my junior year of high school and I had to quit playing piano, I was unbelievably happy.

But damnit, I was one of the best young piano players in the state of Iowa. I won our regional auditions <del datetime="2013-08-27T19:48:30+00:00">nearly</del> every year I completed, and won the state level competitions twice. I won money performing at our Bill Riley talent contest, and I was the anchor to my school's annual variety shows from kindergarten through 9th grade. The talents she helped me develop led to me picking up percussion, bass, and guitar. I majored in music education my first year in college before the arm damage caught up to me. Music and playing the guitar are my greatest passions in life. I'm actually in the process of recording a solo EP at the time of this writing (edit: <a href="http://http://themusicplaysyou.com/" target="_blank">it's done</a>). If I'd stuck with piano, I probably could've gotten a full ride to a university somewhere.

None of this would've been possible without the sacrifices that my mother made throughout my lifetime. I wish more than anything that I could go back and be more receptive to her instruction. My arm may have still given out, and I may have still quit, but I never showed my appreciation for the talent she helped me hone and develop into what it is today. That ability means the world to me, and I would be lost without it.

My mother also instilled a whole bunch of other things in me. She was the one that cultivated my interest in reading. She may have forced me to read some books that I didn't enjoy, but she also let me read anything else as well. She hounded me about finances, making sure I set up a budget. She was home every single day when I was home from school, keeping a watchful eye on me and making sure I didn't get myself into too much trouble. She drug me to church as a child, and supported my decisions to become involved on my own as I grew up. She indirectly showed me the value of dedication and hard work, and how they can lead to doing great deeds in life.

My mother has the ultimate servant's heart. She gives and teaches and molds, and only asks for enough in return so that she can start over again the next day. She's done so with me for almost 26 years, and I've witnessed countless students come through her studio to get educated on the arts, and come out of it learning about what it means to have a work ethic. It's inspiring and humbling to reflect on.

This is not an obituary. This is not a "poor me" post or anything like that. My mother is not dead, and her presence is certainly not gone from my life.

**Instead, this is a reminder to everyone that life is precious, and so are friends and family.** Call that person you haven't talked to in a while. Tell people how you feel. Tell people you love them. Life is far too short for "well, I'll do that tomorrow". You never know when the won't be a tomorrow for you or them. Be receptive to life lessons, as much as they might sting. Seek knowledge and truth, as opposed to filling your brains with muck. Build up others instead of seeking self-gratification. Go through life with a purpose; make it a better place than it was when you came into it.

Oh… and fuck cancer.
