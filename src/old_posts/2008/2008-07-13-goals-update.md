Man, it's been a long time...  I thought maybe I'd do a quick goals update.

1) Money.  Still going rough... it's gonna be hit or miss if I'm gonna make it in time.

2) I've actually gained more weight this summer... though I did lose 3 pounds yesterday wearing my KSE jacked while playing a show in Earlham, IA with Fireflight.  That was fun.

3) Songs are being written.  I shall start recording probably Wednesday or Thursday.  I've got 2 ideas that I'm introducing to Crossed in the near future, and a bunch (about 5 to 30) of ideas floating around.

4) WoW is fun.  I've cut back a little bit lately, with work, band, and other stuff going on, but I'm still getting my playing time in.  I have my 70, have another one that just hit 58 tonight, and I'm progressing nicely with both.

5) Various joint issues still bothering me, but nothing serious to this point.

6) Only 852 songs that I haven't listened to yet... I'm doing pretty good.  Also, I'm gonna try and review a few CD's here in the near future.

Well, this was nice... both for me, and for any of you that still read this.
