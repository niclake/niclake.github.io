[![](images/149.jpg)](http://www.equalvision.com/media/releases/149.jpg)Just got my hands on a copy of Damiera's "Quiet Mouth Loud Hands".  Any CF graduates that know Steve Downs or Josh Sparks... this is their band.

Any Damiera fans will notice the instant difference between this album and M(US)ic.  Generally, the musical scope is much broader, and though the term gets thrown around a lot as a negative term, they've gone more "mainstream".  This is not always a bad thing; in this case, it's both a maturing process, as well as the fact that only Dave Raymond (vocals, guitar) still remains with the band since the M(US)ic days.  Joining him are Steve Downs (guitar), Josh Sparks (drums) and Jayson Dezuzio (bass).

I'm actually going to try and go through the CD, and type my thoughts live.  If the track ends, I'll go on and come back later.  Unfortunately, I don't have any lyric listings, so I'll be going by ear in regards to those.

Rainman - Quiet song... sounds almost like a dark lullaby of sorts.  Short.

Quiet Mouth Loud Hands - Standard rock.  Definitely grooves.  Parts of it almost sound like a 2008 version of a Michael Jackson song... we're just missing the crotch grab, I guess.  Already I'm noticing a big difference between the Damiera of old and the Damiera of now.  There's a couple stylistic influences here that were never present before.  This song is more open and full, whereas the old Damiera was based around quicker rhythms and complex guitar/bass parts.  You can hear some of that in this song, but this song (being the title track) could easily be something you'd hear on the radio hear in the near future.

Nailbiter - Ah, here we go.  Here's the Damiera that I know and recognize.  Dave is not at all afraid of going all over the charts with his voice... in just these few songs, I've heard him progress through a few octaves, all of it sounding really good.  This song brings his higher range back to more prominence.

I hate to continue to bring up comparisons of old, but even though there are a few similarities, this is definitely \*not\* old Damiera.  I love the old stuff, but this newer stuff is definitely great so far.  You don't have all the instruments off doing their own things anymore; it's more of a cohesive work.

Image And Able - Slower, grooving song.  Man, talk about Dave jumping around with vocals... awesome.  I love the way they pick things up and start to drive it about 1:20 into the song, then back it right back off.  These guys definitely have what it takes to make it, judging by what I've heard so far.  The effects/mixing on Dave's higher vocals can at times be a little piercing/grating, but everything else is quite polished, working great together vocally/instrumentally, and it sounds awesome.

Teacher, Preacher - A kinda quiet techno-y opening here... kicking right into what almost sounds like belongs in a Justin Timberlake rock song.  Really funky, definitely something that you move to.  Keeps the rock and punk elements to it while making this thing really groove.  I seriously wonder how much Michael Jackson these guys listened to for inspiration... I'm not complaining at all, though.  Have a couple harmonies/gang vocals on this track (and a few before too) which is always cool.  Love this song.

Weights For The Waiting - Starts off with light bass/guitar over some background feedback, then kicks in to the song.  Here's some more of their old selves coming back into play, yet these guys are really starting to lock down their chords and progressions between (I'm assuming) Dave and Jayson.  Before, all 3 instrumental parts would be flying all over the place... now, you're getting some root, some meat to the song, while still having the lead complement the song nicely.  I think this is the first song that I've heard the chorus melody sung at that low of a register... still sounds really nice though.

Chromatica - Nope, I lied.  \*Here's\* old Damiera.  Rhythmic, choppy, notey, then backing off to a quiet, almost reflective moment before jumping back in.  Love the bass groove here, really drives this song through the verses.  Hilarious... dissonance resolving into graceful harmonies in the guitars.  Instrumental a little boring here, nothing much going on... back into the rhythm, more vocal harmonies, more driving.  Even still, they're managing to keep things really open through this song, letting everything soar and stand out all on it's own.

Blinding Sir Bluest - Starts out kinda like Teacher, Preacher... really funky/80's-and-90's poppy feel going on here.  Everyone is definitely showing not only a range of talents that they have on their instruments, but how they can make them all blend and mesh together so nicely.  Vocals and guitars running together gives a really cool effect here... kicks right into a super funky and driving chorus, beautiful harmonies abound.  Suddenly my head bobbing had to stop cause they threw the rhythm off... jerks. :-P  I love how these senseless little breaks that they've got in here translate right back into the song... you hesitate to dance because you think that you're off, but in the time that you get to think about it, the band is already right back where you think they should be.  Awesome.

Woodbox - Any guitarist that's ever heard Kaki King before would love this.  A real Matthews/Johnson acoustic line laid down, complete with driving drums, throw in a little DJing to the mix here, plus a lead acoustic/doubling line... some parts of it get to me cause there's either tuning or harmonic dissonance in here quick enough that it drives me nuts.  Really cool track, short instrumental.

Silvertongue - Almost done here.  Starts off real quiet, faded in the background, then kicks in and knocks you back in your chair.  More stretched and soaring vocals with a running lead guitar, a kickin' and rhythmic chorus, then just drops the floor out from under you for a second before jumping back in, still the same groove, but with a little blues/jazz guitar feel, before a quiet guitar instrumental (well, it was quiet).

Trading Grins - I'm not quite sure what to expect from this intro... not techno, but almost an industrial/electronic intro feel to it here... keeps going with the octave vocals here.  You start grooving to the bass-and-clap rhythm going on here, with the classic fuzz on bass and a quiet guitar rhythm going on in the background.  Kicks into almost a fuzz breakdown, then cuts to bass and clap and out.

I guess this turned into more of a synopsis of each song than I originally intended, but it's definitely a cool way to look at things.

While they're definitely different, I find that it's great to hear bands playing all styles of music all at once.  It's a refreshing look at music, and definitely nice compared to listening to 40 minutes of the same thing over and over again like other bands nowadays offer.

I'm definitely a fan of Chromatica and Teacher, Preacher... not so much on Trading Grins.  Maybe just too much difference for me, or maybe it's just because Damiera kinda hung me out to dry with giving me such a short album.

Before I review, know this... if I was giving this a review based on the old Damiera, I would give them a 3/10.  There's really not a lot of the old band in this album, which is startling and a little disappointing.  However, if I want that style, I'll put in M(US)ic.  This is a whole different look at things.

I give this album a 8.5/10 for ingenuity, creativeness, ballsiness, and musicianship.  They're definitely not like any one band you've ever heard before, instead drawing their influences from all over the board and combining them together, giving you tastes of skill and flashiness with an overall raw and driving performance.  This will definitely be spinning in my CD player (or my hard drive, I guess) for a while.  I recommend you go grab yourself a copy when it's released on June 24th.
