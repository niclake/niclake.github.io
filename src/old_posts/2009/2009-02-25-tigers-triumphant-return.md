Tiger Woods has proven, yet again, that he is not human.

Returning after an 8 month layoff, Tiger made an appearance at the Accenture Match Play Championship, facing off against 64th ranked Brendan Jones on the opening day.  Tiger took his normal hour to warm up, with things just business as usual.

His front nine was... well, average.  A birdie started off his day, but he went on to bogey 3, and 7.  Luckily, Jones was only able to win hole 7, as they matched each other pretty evenly up until that point.  Tiger made birdie on 8, par on 12 and eagle on 13 to put himself 4 up, essentially sealing himself as the winner for the day.

It is unthinkable, how Tiger is able to continue his consistent and excellent play after not playing since June of last year.  For those that don't remember, Tiger pulled off a victory at the US Open, then had surgery on his knee to repair a torn ACL.  While he obviously wouldn't have returned to the course before he felt ready, I don't think anyone expected this performance out of him... possibly not even Woods himself.

Of course, he did show that all great players struggle sometimes. It took Woods exactly 59 minutes into his round before uttering a curse, that being on the 5th hole when he put a poorly placed drive into the nearest bunker.

But really... can we blame him?

Tiger, I'm disappointed.  You're toying with us.  You could've easily come out here, shown this Aussie who's boss, and walked off the course with 12 hole-in-ones (that's right, 12.  He would've parred 1 hole to give Jones fleeting hope, and maybe a few birdies just for good measure).  The doctors/surgeons/robotic technicians fixed you to be dominant again, not to play around with your fans and your competition.  Winning 3 & 2?  I don't know what the \*perfect\* match play score is, but you should've had it.

Actually, there's a rule in the golfers rulebook now... hitting 3 holes-in-one in a row now is officially called a "Tiger".

Tomorrow Tiger faces off against Tim Clark, who beat Retief Goosen 3 & 2 as well to move on.  A mere mortal, Tim faces a tough task matching up against Woods, with 0 career PGA Tour wins compared to 65 under Tiger's belt.

I propose a new rule... one that makes competition a little more fair.  Tiger gets a 7 iron and a pool cue, and that's it.

Somehow, I don't think that would even matter.
