I want to send a special thank-you to Ron (NebraskaRSFan) over at [New England Sports Country.com](http://www.newenglandsportscountry.com).  He and the other moderators on the site have graciously set me up with a little gig writing about the Red Sox.  For now, a lot of things posted over there will be the exact same as the Red Sox analysis I do here, but eventually I'll begin writing exclusives for that site only.

If you're a fan of New England-area sports (Red Sox, Bruins, Patriots, Celtics, etc), you may want to check that site out... tons of information from people across the nation, and a lot of insider info that many of us in the "outside world" might not acquire otherwise.

Thanks again, Ron!
