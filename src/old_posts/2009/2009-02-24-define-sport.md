Theoretically easy, right?

[Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sport)'s first definition is as follows...

> An athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature, as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc. 

Ok, so... we obviously have some things established as "sports" by this definition.  What about more specifics?  Competitive chess?  Video games?  Or (the common one) cheerleading?

Post your thoughts.
