I wrote this on my birthday earlier this year... time to analyze.

> So, here we go. 2009 MLB predictions... not exactly as you might expect them.

> 1. We are not done with this whole steroid saga, not by a long shot. This season alone, I'm guessing no fewer than 3 big-time players are going to come out/be forced out, admitting to their use of steroids or performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs, for the sake of this article). Whether it was an old usage back when it wasn't illegal, or a current usage that causes a suspension, I don't know.
> 2. We are going to see a crazy amount of people doing stupid things at ballparks this year. Streakers, fights in the stands, and things of that sort.
> 3. Out of these stupid things... we're going to have 2 cases of players doing something so ridiculous that the league will have no choice but to suspend him (think Randall Simon and the sausage race, then kick it up a notch).
> 4. Home runs are going to be down, down, down. Steroid and PED usage are going to be down for fear of getting ousted now, and I believe we are going to see a lot more "small-ball" being played... hit and runs, sacrifice bunts/flys, steals, squeeze plays (please?!?), and the like.
> 5. Also to that effect... we will not be seeing some of the "overpowering pitching" that we may have seen in the past. Fewer strikeouts overall this season, especially from the power pitchers. There's going to be less emphasis on swinging for the fences, and more on just making good contact this season. Crafty pitchers (or those that don't rely on power to do their work) will not see a big dip in their stats.
> 6. The Tigers, Royals, Reds, and Padres will not be "joke" teams this year. While they won't make it to the playoffs, they will be a tough out, hovering just above .500, and at least one of these teams will kill some playoff pushes for another team.
> 7. NL Division Winners - Mets, Cubs, Diamondbacks (WC: Phillies)
> 8. AL Division Winners - Red Sox, Twins, Angels (WC: White Sox)
> 9. NL Playoffs - Cubs over Phillies, Mets over Diamondbacks - Mets over Cubs
> 10. AL Playoffs - Red Sox over White Sox, Twins over Angels - Twins over Red Sox (man, that hurt to type)
> 11. 2009 World Series Champion - Minnesota Twins over the New York Mets

Well, first of all... #1, I was dead on.  A-Fraud, Ortiz, and Manny.

#2 - Dead wrong.

#3 - We had quite a bit of throwing at the head/upper body this year, but nothing completely boneheaded.

#4 - Home runs are down everywhere except at The Wind Tunnel New Yankee Stadium

#5 - A lot of high-powered pitchers dialed it back a bit this year.  Beckett comes to mind.  We saw a \*ton\* of small ball being played across the league, with steals of home, bunts, singles, and legging out triples.

#6 - Called this one too (kinda).  Detroit is going to make the playoffs as a division winner.  Padres and Reds have a .493 and .471 current win percentage, respectively.  I missed a bit on the Royals (.414 currently), but Greinke has definitely shown up and given every opponent a great challenge.

#7 - Philly (probably), St. Louis, and LA (probably), with Colorado currently holding off Atlanta and the Giants in the WC.  I kinda got one... /facepalm

#8 - Yankees, Tigers, and Angels (YES!!!), with the Red Sox pretty close to locking up the WC.

9, 10, and 11 I pretty much lose on by default... I can get 1 "point" if the Sox win their first series, but that's it.  So, here are my new predictions.

- First off: Colorado will hold off the other teams for the NL WC.
- AL Playoffs - Boston over Angels in 4, Yankees over Detroit in 4 - Red Sox over Yankees in 6
- NL Playoffs - (figuring StL will finish with a better record than Philly) St. Louis over Colorado in 3, Philly over LA in 4 - Philly over St. Louis in 7
- 2009 WS Champs - Red Sox over Philly in 6

I can only hope, right?  Hah.
