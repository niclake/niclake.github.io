Today is Wednesday, the 1st of July.  Tomorrow, I take my first final in a year and a half.  Slightly nervous, but I think I'll do ok. :-)

If you don't follow @[DwightHoward](http://www.twitter.com/DwightHoward) on Twitter yet, you should.  His messages make me laugh, no matter what mood I'm in.

Blog posts lately have been kinda "meh"... Maybe this weekend when I have a few days off, I'll have a chance to write a bit more.

Interesting article I just found... "[Raising a Healthy Gamer: 7 Tips for Parents](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/06/parenting-and-video-games.ars)".  I'm kinda shocked... not used to seeing anything even mildy pro-gaming published on a major web site.  Maybe this is really showing how much times are changing... good.

I didn't go to Sturgis Falls.  Not even once.  I feel kinda strange about that... first time in 22 years that I was in town and didn't attend.  Oh well... I still managed to enjoy my weekend tremendously. :-)
