Yep... bad jokes are now taking over my blog post titles.  It's the best I can come up with while I'm here at work.

Apparently writing a post that included the Metrodome was a huge boost for [my sports blog](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com)... with the name change (it's now known as the Mall of America Field at Hubert H. Humphry Metrodome), the Vikings/Packers game, and the Twins/Tigers 1-game playoff coming up this weekend, lots of searches have apparently hit my blog.

At this current point in time... I am craving chinese food.  I'm thinking an order of General Tso's chicken may be acquired this evening after I get off of work.

[Allyn had a great link that he found this evening](http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-01/why-dumb-toys-make-kids-smarter/)... a really interesting read, both for kids from my generation as well as young, up-and-coming parents.

I think there's something about the weather this time of year that puts me into a weird funk.  Don't get me wrong, I love fall... football, holidays, the weather, it's all wonderful.  But the last couple of years, I've always gotten a little moody around this time, and I guess I'm not really sure why.  The cold weather messes with my arm a little bit, so maybe that has something to do with it.  Maybe it's just knowing that my window of opportunity for playing golf has more than likely closed completely.  Boo.

Hot chocolate and peppermint schnapps is delicious.  Drinking said hot chocolate while playing guitar makes for an outstanding evening.

If you're a progressive rock fan (Rush, The Mars Volta, Dream Theater, etc), you should check out the band Closure in Moscow.  Their debut album "First Temple" is absolutely outstanding.

Getting a coupon for a free drink at Becks is amazing.  They hand them out during Monday Night Football, as well as better coupons for the people who answer their football trivia questions correctly.  I'm going back tomorrow when the Vikings play, so I'm hoping to snag a free meal or something like that. :-P

November is approaching... that means that the National Novel Writing Month (or NaNoWriMo) is almost here.  I'm debating on whether I should participate this year... it's always a fun time, and it gets me writing, which I love to do.  On the other hand, I'm really trying to focus on school this year, I don't really have a good idea to write about (yet), and I'm hoping to have another distraction within the next month or so.  If you've got any ideas, shoot them my way. :-)

I swear... the next person that follows me on Twitter based on something I say, I will hunt down and poke ferociously.  I was just joking around with one of my friends about my physics quiz, and I get followed by "Dr. Radi Al-Jishi (prof\_physics)".  Seriously?  /facepalm

And I'll leave you with a video a new friend introduced me to.  I was laughing so hard at this...
