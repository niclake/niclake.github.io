On an unrelated note, I've been pointed to a great website called AppStorm, full of all sorts of information and great applications for Macs.  Anyway, they have a contest going on right now [allowing people to win a free license of ExpanDrive](http://mac.appstorm.net/general/competitions/the-big-expandrive-giveaway-10-licenses-up-for-grabs/).  Check it out.
