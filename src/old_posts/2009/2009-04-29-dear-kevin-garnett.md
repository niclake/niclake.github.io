You are the man.  I love your heart when it comes to basketball and defense.  But really... your "fierce" look that you do?  It looks like you just realized that someone took a #2 in your Gatorade cup.

I recommend calling Tyra Banks, get a little "Next Top Model" training.  Your scowl on the sidelines after a big play does nothing but make me giggle like a high school cheerleader.  I'm honestly glad I couldn't find a picture of this, because I wouldn't be able to stop laughing long enough to write this post.

Get healthy soon... I hope your injury isn't serious.  Keep doing your leadership thing... it's great, and for the most part, it seems to be working.  Get your guys fired up, and keep them energized.  But please... fix the fierce.
