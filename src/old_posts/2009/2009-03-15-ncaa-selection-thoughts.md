I'm going as the brackets go... so let's see.  We'll start with the opening round games.

\*\*\*MIDWEST\*\*\*

1) They got the 4 #1 seeds right... but not in the right order.  Louisville is hot, yes, and they won the Big East tournament... but they are not the best team in the nation.  The order should be: Pitt > UConn > UNC > Louisville in my opinion.  But hey, I'm sure all of these teams are happy.

2) Not having Memphis as a 1 is (again) exactly correct.  Record vs. RPI top 50: 4-2.  The top seeds have (I believe) at least 8 wins.

3) 8 Ohio State vs 9 Siena - That's gonna be a hell of a matchup.  Possible upset there?

4) Arizona made it in as a 12 seed against Utah.  Again, why are bubble teams not shoved in as a lower (13, 14) seed?  Frustrating.

5) 6 West Virginia vs 11 Dayton - That's going to be a great game... and the winner will give 3 Kansas a great run for their money.

\*\*\*WEST\*\*\*

6) Very shocking... 5 Purdue vs 12 Northern Iowa.  I called it, Curt... we got a 12 seed.  You bet 11 seed.  You owe me a dollar.  This is a fantastic matchup for UNI and the Missouri Valley conference... The Big Ten isn't known for their offense, and UNI plays outstanding all around.  Look for an upset here.

7) 7 California vs 10 Maryland - \*\*\*UPSET ALERT\*\*\* Maryland wins this game... and then an epic battle between them and Memphis will commence.

\*\*\*EAST\*\*\*

8) 8 Oklahoma St vs. 9 Tennessee.  I despise Wayne Chism and his stupid headband, but this is going to be a great game (as most 8/9 games are).

9) Wisconsin as a 12.  How?  I honestly didn't even think that they would make it in.  Playing an energetic Florida State team... rough game.

10) 7 Texas vs 10 Minnesota.  That should be exciting... a little Big Ten/Big 12 battle here.

11) 6 UCLA vs 11 VCU - \*\*\*UPSET ALERT\*\*\* UCLA strikes me as a bit of a weak team, and VCU has looked very impressive.  Watch out.

12) \*\*\*Random\*\*\* If I have to see this stupid Sheraton commercial w/ the rival fans 20 times again this season, I'm going to get a little frustrated.

\*\*\*SOUTH\*\*\*

13) 5 Illinois vs 12 Western Kentucky - \*\*\*UPSET ALERT\*\*\* WKU has proven that they can win basketball games (they beat Louisville earlier in the year).  This is a very good potential for an upset right here.

 

ACC, Big East, and Big Ten had 7 teams, 6 out of the Big 12, and only 3 out of the SEC.  Only 1 team from the Missouri Valley... that's right, Andy Katz.  Take my size 10 steel toed boot and stick it somewhere.

Sooo... opening round upsets...

Midwest: 9 Siena, 10 USC

West: 12 Northern Iowa, 10 Maryland

East: 9 Tennessee, 11 VCU

South: 12 Western Kentucky

I was thinking that this might be the year that a 13 or 14 seeded team might pull off an upset... but I was wrong.  None of those teams really impressed me at all this season, and they go up against some stiff competition.  Sorry, guys.  My Iowa Hawkeyes will still have to be the highest rated team to go down in recent memory.

The rest of my bracket, after the opening round:

Midwest: West Virginia upsets Kansas and makes the Sweet 16.  Wake Forest goes on to beat Louisville and Michigan State to make the Final Four.

West: Top picks until Memphis upsets UConn to make the Final Four.

South: Top picks until Villanova upsets Duke into the Elite 8.  Pitt still takes the bracket, though.

East: What a great matchup.  UNC vs. Oklahoma.  That's going to be an epic battle down low right there.  Watch the power of the Big 12 to last 1 more round and slide their way into the Final Four.

So my Final Four is: 4 Wake Forest vs 2 Memphis, 1 Pitt vs 2 Oklahoma.  Memphis will play (and lose) to Pitt in the final game, 76 - 70.
