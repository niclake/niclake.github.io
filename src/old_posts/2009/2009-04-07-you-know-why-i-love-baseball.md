Sportscenter's Top 10 plays of the night... 10-2 were stud defensive plays at various positions, and #1 was an Emilio Bonifacio inside-the-park homer.  Opening day, folks.  162 game season, and these guys are going full-out from the first pitch.  You never see that in college sports (since they schedule wimpy opponents as their "preseason), and even football is a little slow in week one.

Oh, and did I mention that Bonifacio stole 3 bases too?
