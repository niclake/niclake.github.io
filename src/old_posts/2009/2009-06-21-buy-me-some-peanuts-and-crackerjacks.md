This is honestly one of the better summers that I think I've had in a long, long time.

I'm finally starting to get my life and things figured out, in all sorts of ways.  School every morning, sometimes working in the evenings, studying... truly, it doesn't take nearly as much time as people made me think it would.  Next month will be a different story with my Marketing class, but that's ok.  Lots of disc golf, a couple rounds of golf, some great weather and a pool, and friends that are actually around this summer... you can't really beat that.  I even found a beer that I enjoy... Shock Top Belgian White.  I bought it for Doug since he got a hole in one this week, and had a little bit of it... perfect for the summer.

I think I'm ready to leave Cedar Falls, at least for a while.  Obviously, I've got 3(ish) more years of school left, but there's just something about this town... actually, this state... that I'm really just ready for a break from.  The last time I was out of this general area was when I went to Sioux Falls, SD with the band last summer.

Who knows, maybe its just a weekend thing, and I just need to get out for a couple of days or something.  Maybe I actually need to move elsewhere for a bit... who knows.  I've wanted to go visit my cousins in Chicago for a few years now, and I think that at the end of the summer I should finally have enough money to do that.  I guess I'm just kinda worried that I'm going to love it so much that I'm going to want to move there. :-P

Hillcrest Apartments should offer a maid service.  I'd utilize the service once to get my room cleaned.  I'm sure my roommates would make bi-weekly calls for their rooms and their share of the kitchen.

Have you ever wondered when it is or isn't appropriate to talk to someone?  For example... someone that I met very recently and don't know very well has been going through some hard times this week, and I wanted to say something last night.  I didn't, because I thought it would be a little weird.  I saw another Facebook status from them this morning that was kinda down, and thought "what the heck".  It ends off that this morning was just the right time, and we talked about what was going on for some 20ish minutes, just passing messages back and forth.  I don't really know anything new about this person, but it just makes me smile knowing that I was able to talk to and help some relative stranger.

On an unrelated note... sunburn hurts.  I forgot that only my arms had burned so far, and not my shoulders.  Ouch.

The US Open is really interesting this year.  Some of the heavy hitters are getting absolutely screwed over this year, since the course is soaked and playing insanely soft.  At the same time, anyone with any sort of short game is able to make some incredible shots right at the hole.  Right now, drives and putts are absolutely decimating the competition.  Those clubs are always the most important in any golfers bag, but they're really extra important now.

I'm really happy, in a geeky sort of way.  Bernie Williams, former outfielder for the New York Yankees and now an excellent acoustic guitar player, released a variation of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" on his latest album.  I thought it was insanely cool, and devoted an afternoon to figuring out how exactly it was that he played it.  Well, lo and behold, my newest issue of Guitar Player Magazine had the official tab printed in it, and I was pleased to find out that I was off by just 1 fingering (a fretted string instead of an open one like I'd been playing it).

For those of you that don't know... [there \*is\* a huge difference between being a geek and a nerd.  A blog I read pretty often further went in to clarifying this](http://diamondkt.blogspot.com/2009/06/how-being-geek-will-get-you-girl.html)... here's a little excerpt from the article.

> There is a huge difference between a geek and a nerd. A nerd is unaware of their "nerdom". They are usually social misfits. Isolating themselves from the rest of the world, they obsess over a single interest (usually sci-fi related) in lieu of developing acceptable social skills among their peers. This of course leads them to a life full of socially awkward behavior, thus making them an outcast to society and often keeping them extremely immature in psychological and emotional development. They will live in their Mom’s basements as 40-year-old virgins playing Dungeons & Dragons and going to Star Wars conventions on the weekends. Calling someone a nerd is seen as an insult. However, calling someone a geek should be taken as a compliment because it’s almost in vogue to be called a geek.
> 
> Geeks are not social misfits. They maintain a full social schedule and are merely more knowledgeable than the average Joe about a specific topic. These people are passionate about a particular hobby or interest. And in the eyes of a women, a guy who is passionate about something in life translates to sexy! You can be a geek in really anything, whatever interests you. Geeks are aware of their "geekdom" and most geeks embrace this title. You could call me a tech geek or a sport bike geek (two passions of mine) and I wouldn’t be offended. **The main difference between a geek and a nerd is that a geek finds balance in life and a nerd cannot.**

It goes on to explain why geeks are the "in" thing right now, and how being a geek will (supposedly) get you the girl.  Made me smile on a rough day.

I feel kinda shady... I've been a Mac guy since 5th grade, following Apple products religiously... and I haven't touched my Mac in about a week and a half, except to turn on music before going to bed.  I've been using my Ubuntu machine since the week before my class started, trying it out since I promised a friend of mine that I would give it a shot.  I'm hooked for a couple of reasons... 1) it's a bigger, more powerful laptop, 2) the battery lasts more than an hour (with the travel battery I have on it, it actually lasts 4 hours), so it's actually able to leave my desk, and 3) since I'm doing all of my class notes on this machine, it makes sense that it is the one I have around me all the time.  Only downfall: I haven't found a good music player (seriously... I randomize by album for a reason, and the only software that has that feature actually in it, the option is grayed out).  I still really want to get a new Mac though... I can't decide if I'd rather have an iMac or a MacBook Pro.  I gotta get the money first, though, and that will take a while.

Another completely unrelated side note... the Nissan Cube (top) is quite possibly the ugliest car I've ever seen.  It makes the Scion xB (bottom) look sleek and sexy by comparisson.

Movies I want to see: Phelam 123, Transformers, Star Trek, UP!.  Maybe I'll go see one of those this week... anyone want to go?
