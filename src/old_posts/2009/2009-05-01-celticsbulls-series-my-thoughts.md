![](images/62276_Bulls_Celtics_Basketball.jpg)I have to back up a little bit when I write this, going waaaaay back to the evening of March 12 of this year.  No, I'm not looking at any NBA game... I'm looking squarely at the UConn/Syracuse 6OT thriller in the Big East tournament.  I have witnessed quite possibly the greatest single game in basketball (that game), as well as the greatest series (this Celtics/Bulls playoff series) within the span of 2 months.

Wrap your head around that a little.  Then say it with me... wow.

My thoughts on this series:

• The Celtics are not themselves without Kevin Garnett.  He is on the sidelines right now in a suit, fired up just as much as the next guy ([with quite the interesting look on his face](http://wordstoplayby.wordpress.com/2009/04/29/dear-kevin-garnett/)), but obviously he's not on the floor, and this severely hurts the team.  He's obviously a great defender, and in turn makes everyone around him better.  He also gives the team increased depth at the "big" position.  When Perkins fouling out of last night's game 6 loss, it pretty much left Moore (who's a designated backup), Davis (who's not really "big" in height), and Scalabrine (if this guy isn't Irish, I'd be surprised... but also is not tall enough to be considered "big").

• I just heard an amazing idea on ESPN this morning, and I hope the Celtics take it to heart.  According to Ray Allen, Garnett has been going through practices just fine.  While everyone says that KG has been shut down for the remainder of the season... how amped up do you think the fans and the other Celtics would get if he dressed and warmed up with the team?  I think it's a brilliant idea.  Rivers might not like it though, because then he'd be too tempted to put him in.

• Rondo... my man.  You're an awesome player, dude... but seriously.  Mellow.  2 iffy, borderline "dirty" plays in the  last two games with your foul on Miller (I still don't think he was going for anything dirty) and Heinrich (if you look closely at the replay, the two were tied up, then Rondo made some space and Kirk started to stumble backwards with nothing to lean on... but then Rondo threw him).  The last thing I want to see is you walk away from this series, win or lose, with the reputation of a dirty player over your head, or even as a "gray-area" player like Stockton was.  I admire your courage and spunk as you jump through the lane to snag a rebound over some of the 7 footers, and we all know that you're a stud because of how you've played the last 2 seasons.  Man up, and don't let the Bulls get the better of you mentally.  You getting tossed from a game would be catastrophic right now.

• Stephon Marbury.  You obviously took my blog posts a little too literally.  There are times in every game when any competent player has to be a selfish jerk.  The other night (I think it was game 5... maybe 4), you were given the ball in the corner with a wide open 3 pointer in an overtime of the NBA playoffs.  Shoot the \*&^@#$&^ ball.  There's no question.  You, Rondo, House, and especially Allen (heck, throw Scalabrine in that list too) should have absolutely no qualms about shooting a wide open 3 pointer in a situation like that.  Instead, you passed the ball down low to Perkins(??  I think it was Perkins anyway) who was screening for you and had an obvious double team on him, forcing him to put up a shady, contested shot... and miss.  I realize that you have a reputation that's gonna take a long long time to repair, but passing up a shot like that is \*not\* the way to do it.  Making it, however, will do wonders for you.

• Do you realize that, beyond the Celtics blowout in game 3, the other 5 games have been decided by 2, 3, 3,  2, and 1 points.  7 overtimes over those 5 games.  Absolutely insane.
