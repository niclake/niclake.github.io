I'm slowly learning that I am incredibly lucky right now.

2009 has been an absolutely stellar year for sports thus far.  College basketball, NFL Playoffs, the first month of the MLB season, and some stellar NBA games, plus a handful of other events that made their way onto my radar.  It's pretty epic, when you think about it.

You had to love the feel good story of Kurt Warner and the Arizona Cardinals this year.  Honestly, it was really tough for me to root one way or another in the Super Bowl this past season... the Steelers, who I've always admired as a solid and aggressive organization, or the Cardinals, whose offense dazzled, and who had Warner (a graduate of the University of Northern Iowa, where I reside) leading the charge.  A great game was had, some stellar plays were  made, and the Steelers managed to bring a championship to Pittsburgh.

Then there's college basketball.  I honestly can't remember how many ups and downs we had all over the place.  Griffin, T.Hans, Thabeet... it was a season of the big men.  The Big East was absolutely solid all season, and the ACC didn't disappoint either.  A slightly lackluster NCAA Tournament was overshadowed by the individual conference tournaments.  A bunch of surprises, an epic battle between Syracuse and UConn... it was absolutely fantastic.

Baseball... well, we all know that they play 162 games, and that we're only through 1 month.  My fantasy team has ups and downs... got plenty of offensive production, and plenty of innings pitched... but they seem to not understand that a low ERA is better.  I seriously can beat my opponent by about 20 IP every week, and still lose in the Ks, ERA, and WHIP categories.  Really frustrating.  But enough about that... some of the plays that have been made thus far... a couple of triple plays, a couple of cycles, a lot of power hitters slumping, a lot of relative unknowns stepping up both offensively and defensively.  Oh, and an inside-the-park HR.

And then we get the NBA.  I just shrug my shoulders at the regular season... I'll watch the Suns, the Celtics and (maybe) the Lakers play, but that's really about it.  But every time the playoffs roll around, magic seems to happen.  Players hit their "Oh yeah, we should probably start trying now" switch, and you get epic an 7-game series between the Celtics and Bulls, and... oh, no, that's it.  All the other series were a bunch of yawners.  But now we have Orlando/Boston, and Houston/LA Lakers.  Those both look to be great matchups.  And what about the Nuggets?  They're playing fantastic basketball right now.

But then... ahhh.  Over the course of my college career, I've been... influenced?  Corrupted?  Well, I've had my eyes opened to the wonder of the NHL playoffs.  Again, like the NBA, I don't really care for the regular season.  Unless I'm actually at a hockey game, the regular season can just be a letdown.  60 minutes of dudes skating around, with maybe a total of 2 minutes of stellar plays/goals throughout the game.  But the intensity of the playoffs... the hitting, the speed, the magic with which some of these guys move... it's phenomenal.  Right now, we've got Ovie and Crosby going up against each other... Caps won tonight, but both players pulled out hat tricks for their team.  Crazy.

And then this weekend... 2 events that were absolutely stellar.  First, the Hatton/Pacquiao fight.  The Pacman absolutely dismantled Hatton in the brief time they were in the ring.  As a natural lefty, Pacquiao's right hand was probably the deciding factor in the fight.  It looped out of absolutely nowhere, hitting with power whenever it landed.  I think someone said the punch count in the first round was something like Pacman 76, Hatton 18... or something equally as skewed.  People complained "well, I paid $50 for that, and didn't get what I paid for!"  Would you rather have a 12-round drag out, where the guys end of clinching for the better part of the last 4 rounds?  Not me.  This was explosive, powerful, fast, and exciting.

And then the Kentucky Derby.  Down to 19 horses, with the odds-on favorite out with an ankle injury.  Ho hum, right?

In your dreams.

The race itself is 1.25 miles long.  For the first 3/4 of a mile, Mine That Bird was in 18th.  2nd to last.  And then it's like the horse thought "Oh yeah, I should probably start trying now" (I swear, those damn horses take after the NBA players too much).  The other 18 horses seemed to be trotting for the last half mile.  Mine That Bird \*lunged\* with every stride.  Brushing the rail, weaving in and out of the packs, he ended off winning the Derby by something like 5 or 6 lengths.

 

Wow.

Oh, and don't forget about the Red Sox pulling out the brooms for their first series against the Yank-mes.
