When we think about it, what's the point of college?  We go, we experiment, we write some papers, and we learn a bunch of things that we (probably) will never use again the rest of our lives.  But for some reason, most competitively-paying jobs in the white- and blue-collar world require some sort of degree.  Whether you get a degree in business, engineering, music, communications, or whatever, that piece of paper is pretty much your ticket in to getting a quality job in the future.

But what about pro sports?  Occasionally, we see some people coming right out of high school and making their way into the professional ranks.  There' an ongoing debate in many sporting circles that it's high time for pro sports to make 1, 2, even 3 years of college (or at least an age limit) a requirement in order to become a member of their league.

Many people argue that at age 18, men and women become adults in a legal sense, and therefore should be granted access to the NBA/NFL.  I mean, it's completely possibly that someone gets hired at a job based on sheer talent, without a diploma.  So I guess I could see this side of the argument.

But here's the thing, and the points the leagues try to make.

1. Pro sports are wicked fast.  Faster than college, and much faster  than high school sports.  Obviously, if a team is looking at you while you're in high school, you've probably got that potential, but it's still something you have to adjust to.
2. The learning curve.  Having an extra 1-4 years under your belt in your field never hurts.  You gain a broader knowledge of your profession and can apply it to what you do on a daily basis.  This is true of sports as well; learning to read defenses (or execute them), how to interact with teammates, and so on.
3. The physicality of pro sports.  One word: Shaq.  You're not going to run into a specimen like that in high school, but you may have other crazy big (Thabeet) or strong (Blair) or agile (Curry) in the college ranks.  The more types of players you compete against, the better equipped you will be in the future.

Also, waiting a few years allows you to get into better training programs, to build up your muscles in your body, to get used to an intense season unlike anything you'll ever experience in high school, and to generally just grow up.

Can it.  If they're looking at him now, chances are they'll look at him while he's playing college ball too.  And LeBron James is a freak of nature (in a good way, of course).

> "But Nic, my son hasn't gotten into college yet!"

Tell the sports programs at the schools that he's got pro scouts looking at him.  Give the AD the scout's card so they can chit chat.  By the end of the week, you'll have a scholarship offer on your table.

There is absolutely no reason that the NBA, NFL, and other professional sports shouldn't stipulate rules like this into their contracts.  Granted, the NBA today may be different (LeBron, Kobe, Amaré, KG... all of them with slightly less experience in the pro ranks), but this allows them to get a better gauge of (what turns out to be) their investments before spending the money on them, as well as gives the players themselves an education in case they are unable to succeed in the sporting world.

Or what about coming out early?  Should someone like Greg Oden be allowed to play just 1 season and then walk away from school?  I also think this should be a "no".  The other talk is that if a player doesn't head to the pros right out of high school and instead head to college, they should be required to stay for 2-3 seasons before leaving.  I'm taking the best of both worlds... \*no\* pros right out of high school, \*and\* stay for at least 2 full college seasons.  This will allow them to grow up, become responsible, and take some business and personal finance classes to learn how to better manage their soon-to-be-abundant assets.
