I've noticed something over the past few weeks... placing Pick'em's here in the main page has made me extremely lazy.  No new posts, things like that.

So... if you take a look up at the top of the page, you will see 2 new links... NFL Pick'em, and NCAA Pick'em.  If you're curious about checking out who's picking whom and how the season is going, check there.  I'll try and leave the main page for news-related things from now on.
