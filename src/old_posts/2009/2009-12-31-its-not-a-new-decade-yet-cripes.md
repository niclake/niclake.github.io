This is driving me nuts.  Really, this is not the end of the decade.  Rather, it is the end of the 2000's, and the intro into the 2010's.  I guess you could consider this a "decade", since it's the past 10 years, but going by ordinal numbers, the 201st "decade" is really 2001-2010.  Same reason why the 21st century didn't start until 2001.  We didn't have a Year 0, we went from 1 BC to 1 AD.

There, that's off my chest.

Random thought... you know you've seen a commercial too many times when you can quote the "funny" parts of it while typing, and not even looking at the TV.

![](images/TSq06_IMasterV.jpg)So, this is my stereotypical "Year in Review/Looking Ahead" post.  2009 definitely had it's ups and downs.  I feel like this year, I've experienced the most personal growth I ever have (in more ways than one).  I feel more mature.  I \*am\* heftier.  I've proven to myself that I can do this whole kowlage thing.

2010, on the other hand... well, I'm not really sure what's in store with that.

- A couple "potential" things happening on the radar.  We shall have to see how some of these situations develop.
- More school on the horizon.  Pulled off a 3.27 this semester.  I'd love to boost that a bit more, but one step at a time.  Micro Econ, Financial Accounting, Business Stats, Info Systems, and Philosophy this semester... could be rough.  Gotta buckle down a bit more.
- The guitar rig is slooooowly taking shape.  8-9 pedals and a switch to go, plus a new board and an amp.  .... hrm, maybe I'm farther behind than I originally thought.  Still around $2,500 to spend (probably) on everything.  It'll cost a bit, but it'll be worth it.  One little bit at a time.
- Reconnecting with old friends, meeting with new ones.  Hopefully I can continue the trend that I've started these last 2 months.
- I don't blog about sports anymore.  This annoys me, considering how much sports I've watched.  My mother called me 6 straight days here during break.  "What are you doing?"  "Um... watching football/football/football/football/basketball/football" (depending on what day it was).  I really need to step it up.
- ResNet (campus internet) still sucks.  Still waiting to hear back from the head of the Computer Science department on what he thinks about the nice letter I wrote.
- Making New Year's Resolutions this year.  First time ever.  Hopefully I'll have the willpower to stick to them.  1) No purchasing pop, though if it's in something like a mixed drink or given to me at someone's residence, I can accept it.  2) No buying fast food (McD's, Hardees, BK, Wendy's, etc.  Pablos/chinese food/pizza are still acceptable in reasonable moderation).  3) Work out more (stereotypical, but easily accomplished).  1 & 2 will save me money.  All 3 will help me get healthy.  I'd love to get down to my Christmas 2005 weight of 155, but even just dropping to ~170 will make me thrilled.  I've got a coffee maker for hot water, and tea is very inexpensive.  Water is even less expensive.  Long term goals over short term sugar rush.
- It's high time for me to get back into programming.  Info Systems has me learning PHP/MySQL.  Allyn suggested Ruby and let me borrow a book.  My parents got me a Cocoa language book.  Learning to do this stuff will help me increase my hire-ability in the future.  Long term goals...

My New Year's Plans?  Not sure yet.  I could end off in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago, Des Moines, Kansas City, Waverly, Waterloo, or Cedar Falls.  Yeesh.

I hope you all enjoy the end of your holidays.  Be safe during the New Year festivities, buy yourself a DD, and let's start the year Twenty-Ten (not two-thousand-and-ten... blech) on the right foot.
