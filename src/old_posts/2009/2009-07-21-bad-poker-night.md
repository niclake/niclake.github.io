I went into playing poker tonight with a very open mind.  First time playing on Allyn's real poker table (for the record... it's freakin' sweet), first time playing in about 2 weeks (live, at least... I had played quite a bit of online poker in that time, including getting a Royal Flush and winning ~$65 on that one hand... otherwise, I'd been playing Pot-Limit Omaha High for play chips), and we had a full game of 10 people, plus a waiting list.  Everything was pointing to a fun, enjoyable night.

Then we started playing.

With 10 people playing at a large table, plus the fact that this was a very social game, the play went sloooooooooooooow.  10 hands in 50 minutes, and we saw 1 river (aka all 5 cards dealt out) out of those 10 hands.  5 minutes a hand would be great if we were playing to 4th Street/the river for most of those, but seeing a handful of flops just wasn't worth it.

Also, I got 2 good hands the entire night... I was dealt Ace/Jack suited, and then completely missed on the flop and got muscled out of the hand.  I was dealt a 10/9 offsuit that I played later (more to come).  I got a couple 10/6 suited deals, and saw about 3 gut shot straight draws (aka I have a 6, 7, 9, and 10 either in my hand or on the board, which requires an 8 to make my straight for me) which I couldn't play.  I paid a bit to see a flop with 6/4 offsuit, got low pair and a potential of a straight draw, and stayed in the hand just a little bit longer than I should.  I watched a hand I get lucky with (Queen/9 offsuit) win a huge pot.  Every pot that was played had at least $2 in it, if not a lot, lot more.

So I got anxious.  I was down to around $4, got dealt the 10/9 offsuit, was pushed all in pre-flop, and decided to call.  Allyn flips over pocket Queens.

Fark.

Needless to say, I lost the pot, and was out.  It was extremely frustrating, because that whole night, I played 1 bad hand (the 6/4 offsuit) and one 7th tier hand (10/9 offsuit), coupled with the A/J suited and a few other minor calls to see flops.  I did almost everything right, and I got burned, busted, and was the 2nd person out of 11 sent home.  I had a strategy and everything for the night, and I never once got a chance to try it out.

Needless to say, I'm slightly annoyed right now.

I should add some happy stuff to this.  It only seems fair.

So I'm taking Principles of Marketing right now... it's upper level business course here at UNI, one that a former roommate of mine had a little bit of problems with and I was very nervous about going into it.  My first quiz was kinda rough, and figuring out what this professor wanted on his tests was really scaring me.  Long story short, I studied for 9 hours the day before, and got a straight B on the test.  Pretty happy about that.  Confused about the project that we have to do though, so we'll have to talk to him about that.

Playing lots of guitar recently.  Learning all the songs by Killswitch Engage (they put out a new CD that I've listened to a lot lately).  Also might be doing an acoustic project with a friend of mine, which would be awesome.

My check from Student Loans should be here this week... which means I can finally pay bills and buy some food.  And all the people rejoiced (yay...).  Tons of money, and 90% of it is already allocated.  Refreshing, since I think I'll be able to make it until school starts.  Annoying, since I have a pretty big shopping list of things I would \*like\* to get (new computer, guitar equipment, CD/iPod stereo system for my parent's car, which I'm hopefully getting before school starts... hint hint, Dad!).  Oh well... that's why you save money, right?

Also annoyed because no one is hiring right now.  Everyone's "set" for the summer, and no one wants to hire until school starts... but I've already got a job during the school year.  Right now, I'm not complaining, since it's nice to have the study time... but in 2 weeks when this class is over, I'm gonna get kinda bored.  More bike rides, more working out... hopefully I'll stay entertained.

I swear college is back in session... I've been trying to write this "happy stuff" section for an hour, but the various people on AIM/MSN won't let me away long enough to write this.  Haha.

You know, I just realized... all these times that I've taken naps on my couch?  Yeah... I've been sleeping under a Chicago Bears blanket.  \*shudder\* I think I might have to wash myself in bleach, not to mention burn the blanket.

Enough... I can't get away long enough to write more.  I'll post some later.
