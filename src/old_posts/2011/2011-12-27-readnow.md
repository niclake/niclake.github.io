Ever since I sold my iPad in May, I've neglected my Instapaper queue in favor of other, more frivolous endeavors. Reading on my iPhone is ok, but not great. Using the web app just opens the link in my browser, bombarding me with extra links and ads that I don't want. I've longed for a great desktop app, and politely hinted to Marco that he should develop one.

This must be why he ignored my pleas.

ReadNow was updated just last week, and for $4 you can snag yourself a copy and read all your Instapaper (You have to subscribe to Instapaper in order to use a 3rd party app like this, which costs you $1 a month. Not a big deal.) and Read It Now articles right on your desktop, in a great looking and customizable app.
