Last night at church, we got into a discussion about handling criticism.  You know personally whether or not you take criticism well... but let's be honest, even if we take it well, no one really likes it.  While it may help us get better in the long run, no one truly enjoys getting told that what they did was not necessarily up to par.

A few good points came up during this talk that I wanted to share with you tonight.

1) The key point to taking criticism is to listen. If you go into a critique with an open mind, and are willing to hear the whole critique through, a lot of good can come from it.  Many people wall themselves off and instantly view a critique as an attack on their ability.  Others get caught up on small points early, and think you're nitpicking on something, when you're really talking about something else entirely.  Be receptive, take everything in, and only then should you process the info you just received as a critique. Listening will also help us to determine whether the criticism is meant to be constructive or destructive.  If it's the latter, ignoring it might be ok. ;)

2) Artists can get a little more sensitive about critiques, simply because of the details they put into it.  A musician might put a subtle nuance into a song that you don't even notice, while you go on to critique that part of the song.  Graphic artists, painters, drawers and the like might have subtle shadings, gradients, or other minuscule details that, to them, make their work "pop".  Personally, when I look at the Mona Lisa, I just see a woman. I don't see any fancy work, and as such might be more apt to just shrug and say "meh".  Which leads me to my 3rd point...

3) If some Joe Schmo walked up to me and said "hey, I didn't like this about your guitar playing", I'd be more apt to blow him off.  But if a respected musician came up to me and said "hey, I didn't like this about your guitar playing", I would give it careful consideration.  You don't have to let everything a person says change what you do, and it's fine if you decide to weigh the comments of one person more than another because of who they are/what they do.  But at the same time, realize that by coming up and making a comment or critique, that person obviously felt strongly about what you did, be it good or bad.  Anyone can say "nice job", but it takes passion to say "that guitar lick you played on the 3rd song had a wonderful flow to it" or "the way you combined those colors on that piece really stood out".

4) Critiques help you to be more intentional about what you do in the future.  If you know the thing you did was critiqued very strongly by someone, it doesn't mean you shouldn't use it again in the future. However, you should give it careful consideration when you do, and make sure that it really fits and belongs where you're trying to place it.  Got a reason for that font?  Do you really need to pair those 2 employees together again?  Why are you using that effect on your guitar?  If it makes sense and has a purpose, then go for it.

Critiques should never be things we should shy away from. We should actively seek them in order to improve who we are as people, as well as the things we do.
