For the past year, I've contemplated launching a web site.  I've had the domain for a while now, and even went through the preliminary stages of rough draft development, importing the blog (and bashing my head against the wall for days on end, trying to get it to work right), and so forth.  Then a) I realized that my site had a lot in common with [Gruber's site](http://daringfireball.net/), and 2) I had nothing relevant.

At the time, I had no clients that I'd display on the site... now I have 1. My blogging was in the tank (as it is currently). I realized that very few people want to read about the "personal life" stuff. And there's the whole money issue to throw in on top of that.

But still, I'm haunted every day by my inability to pull the trigger. I'm constantly awed and impressed by those that manage to maintain interesting and enlightening blogs on a regular basis... John Gruber, Shawn Blanc, Patrick Rhone, Ian Hines... these are just a few of the guys I read daily.

Now I have clients. Ok, well, I have client, singular. I'm determined to start writing more, and hosting a site would help me accomplish that. I've finally convinced myself (with the help of some others) that I could pull this off. Money... well, I'm still working on that part. It's not terribly expensive to host a site, but right now that's more than I'm able to reasonably spend on an unknown. Plus, I'd get more experience working with Wordpress (and general) site design, which couldn't hurt if I'm doing the freelance stuff.

So the question is... should I start rounding up some cash in order to get my own site off the ground?
