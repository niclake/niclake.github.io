I struggle mightily with prioritizing things.  I don't know when I picked up this habit, but I really wish I could get rid of it.

Right now, the priorities that I do have are pretty simple.  God, school, volunteering (mostly at church), and friends/family.  Unfortunately, that leaves very little time for any extra hobbies and activities that I'd like to partake in.  Or at least, that's what I tell myself.  Mostly, it's because I try to do things with my friends and be social as much as I possibly can.

Part of my issue is the amount of hobbies that I have, which I'm sure I've mentioned before.  Here's a brief list:

\- Guitar/music - Writing/blogging - Sports - Disc golf - Graphic design - Reading - Various TV shows/movies/Netflix -  Technology - Working out

Music for me is only when I play at church right now. Blogging... well, it's sparing, as you can see. Sports will be prominant for me until October... I love baseball season. Now that the weather is nice, hopefully I'll get out to play more disc golf. I am taking another graphic design class this fall, and hopefully will teach myself some stuff done over the summer . I barely have time to read all the blogs I subscribe to, and haven't read a book in months. I watch Netflix way more than I should, but that's how I like to pass the time, I guess. Technology is an extremely broad category... building web sites, teaching myself programming, learning about stuff, playing with my iPad, gaming with friends, etc.  Working out... well, the 4-month-pregnant belly I'm working on here proves that I haven't done that.

I'm making strides to fix this, however.  When I'm home this summer, I won't fall into the trap of sitting around playing video games.  I'll get out and disc, play my guitar, read and write, and spend time with my parents.  When I'm on the road, I'll probably also read and write, and work out as much as I can.

I should re-name this post to "Video Games Are Ruining My Life".  Mom would have a heart attack reading that title.  Seriously, I don't play THAT much, and when I do, it's with friends.  But that's a considerable chunk of time that I could put towards other things.  Like blogging...

So, a few questions to end with: 1) How do you handle your priorities, and sort them into "get this done meow" things? 2) How do you prioritize your hobbies? 3) Have you ever had to "prune" hobbies from your tree?  How do you make this determination on which ones go?
