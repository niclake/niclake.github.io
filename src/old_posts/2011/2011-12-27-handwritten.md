I always look forward to the holidays. Not because of presents, or spending time with family, or the wonderful food and delicious goodies I consume, though those definitely are perks. No, it's because without a doubt, I receive handwritten notes and cards from my parents and grandmother.

And yet, ever time I receive one of these thoughtful gestures, I feel sad. It's not that I'm against these handwritten gestures. No no no, not at all. Rather, I feel sad because my handwriting is nowhere near up to the caliber of generations past.

I always love opening up a book from my parents and seeing what they've written inside, and not entirely for the content of the message. I love the scrawl of my dad's "A"s and his patchwork cursive handwriting that makes more sense than that dumb "3-humped M" I was taught in 4th grade. I love tracing the loops and arcs of my mom's pen, and the extra flourish on the "R" and "L" as she writes her name. I also love getting letters from my grandma. For years, I had to pass the cards and papers to my mom so she could translate, but as I've aged, I've learned to decipher the scrawls and scratches. It's almost like a code, a mystery for me to unravel.

And I hate that my handwriting looks like I wrote with my pen between my toes.

Don't get me wrong, I can write fairly legibly when I want to. My class notes at the beginning of a semester are always crisp, but by the 2nd week they've degraded to my normal writing. My signature is about the only thing I'm proud of (yes, my "L" looks like a "Z". I like it.), but even that fluctuates every time I put pen to paper. My writing gets sloppy as I write faster, which I feel like I need to do in order to keep up with my racing brain.

And that, right there, is the allure, the draw, of the pen. Those who wield it routinely have such a mastery over their words and thoughts that a bottle of white-out isn't part of their toolbox, white my Delete key is one of the most often-pressed buttons on my keyboard. Perhaps, then, it's not the mastery over the pen that I seek. Perhaps it's a mastery over my mind, over my thoughts, over the way my brain churns out information as I write.
