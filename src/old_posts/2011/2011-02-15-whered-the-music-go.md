I started [a new blog](http://wheredthemusicgo.tumblr.com/) today. Don't worry, this one's not going anywhere.

Taken from the About page:

> I started this blog on a whim today, 15 Feb 2011.  After watching the Grammy’s, seeing Arcade Fire win Best Album, hearing Mumford & Sons crush it, seeing a [recap video of Mayer, Urban and Jones performing together](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9cmiK8C0LU), and being amazed by all of that collective talent, I thought to myself… _what the hell is wrong with the music industry today? Where’d the music go?_
> 
> VH1 is slacking, unless you’re up at 3am.  MTV stopped being about music years ago.  So I thought I’d start this blog as a landing place for “good music”.  Music that does more than just sell sex, parties, and boobs to the general populace.  This is for music that moves you, that makes you really go “whoh”.
> 
> Submissions are welcome.  There is no genre requirement.  Just shoot me a YouTube link to my Twitter account, [@niclake](http://www.twitter.com/niclake).  I’ll give it a listen, and if it makes the cut, I’ll put it in the queue.

Seriously, give me submissions.  I want to introduce people to new, good music, and wouldn't mind discovering more for myself in the process.
