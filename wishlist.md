Hello! If you're reading this, you've apparently tracked down the Lake Family Holiday Wishlist (somehow). This is a list of ideas to get Nic or Becca for the holiday season!

If you are wanting to get stuff for us, but are wondering where to send it, you can find my contact info on my [About page](http://niclake.me/about/).

## Family List/House Upgrades

Asking for money is weird. We get it. But for the most part, rather than "stuff", we'd prefer to make some changes to our house before Baby Lake joins us. So, here's the things that we'd be spending money on, if picking out gifts is difficult:

- A new deck (since ours is broken)
- Finishing the basement for Nic's office (& freeing up a room for the nursrey upstairs)
- Home humidifier
- Lighting updates to living room, kitchen, front room, & bedroom
