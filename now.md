These are the things currently occupying my time & attention, in no particular order.

### Personal Stuff

- V is 2 now, and she's great. An all-consuming, boundary-testing, nonstop ball of energy, but great nonetheless. Her grasp of language is exploding every day, she's funny as hell, and the way she grasps patterns is nothing short of astounding to me[^2]. I'm blessed to be her dad.
- I'm still working as a software developer, but I've taken a couple of internal interviews for some engineering management positions. Unknown what the future holds for me as of yet, but going through the process has been enjoyable thus far.
- I was diagnosed with adult ADHD last month. The first medication we tried had a not fun side effect, so I get to talk with my doctor tomorrow to see what we can do about a dosage or prescription change. But honestly, just having the diagnosis has been very enlightening to me, helping me better understand myself and some of my quirks.
- Schedules have definitely been flexing over the past few months, but I've been attempting to spend as much time as possible in my father-in-law's woodshop. So far, my accomplishments have been some shelves for our built-ins, a couple cutting boards, a keyboard wrist/palm rest, some cases for one of my keyboards, and a birdhouse for my wife. I've got aspirations of doing a lot more with this hobby, and hopefully I'll be able to find some more time to carve out and spend over there.
- I've found my video game time has dropped to practically nil as of late. I haven't played a game that I've loved yet this year (Cyberpunk 2077 was the last I played), and as V's bedtime gets later and later, the prospect of firing up a game for a shorter block of time just doesn't appeal to me as much as it used to. More of an observation than a complaint; priorities change.
- I've managed to let [/r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/)'s Book Bingo Challenge draw me in to reading more. I've already completed 3 of the 25 squares in 3 weeks, and convinced a couple of friends to participate with me (hooray, accountabilibuddies). I've just started Steven Erikson's _Gardens of the Moon_, and I'm excited to see what else I discover this year.
- It's prime sports watching season for me. Baseball is back in full swing[^3], the NBA playoffs start this weekend, F1 races are happening, the end of the Premier League season is approaching... and I wonder why I don't make time for anything else. ðŸ˜‚
- I have 2 tabs open that may or may not cause me to rework my blog's tech stack.
- We might (_might_) be maybe thinking about considering getting a kitten or two.
